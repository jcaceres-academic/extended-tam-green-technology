## 📘 Project overview

This repository provides **open, transparent, and reproducible research materials** supporting the conceptual and analytical development of an **extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** for the study of green technology adoption.

Rather than offering primary empirical datasets or predictive models, the repository documents the **analytical workflow**, **bibliometric procedures**, and **conceptual structuring** that underpin the article’s theoretical contribution. The materials are intended to support **methodological transparency**, **interpretative clarity**, and **future empirical replication**.

The project integrates perspectives from **environmental psychology**, **behavioural public policy**, and **sustainability governance**, with a particular focus on institutional dimensions such as trust, legitimacy, transparency, and community support.

## 📁 Repository structure

- `docs/`  
  Rendered project website (GitHub Pages), including methodological notes and conceptual diagrams.

- `scripts/`  
  Reproducible scripts used for bibliometric mapping and semantic analysis (R, VOSviewer workflows).

- `figures/`  
  Conceptual figures and analytical visualisations used in the article.

- `tables/`

## 🔁 Reproducibility and transparency

This repository follows principles of **open science**, **conceptual reproducibility**, and **methodological transparency**.  
All analytical steps reported in the article are documented to allow other researchers to:

- trace the analytical logic of the study,
- reproduce the bibliometric mapping procedures,
- adapt the conceptual framework to alternative sustainability or policy contexts.

The materials are provided for **research and educational purposes**, and are not intended to function as a ready-made predictive or decision-support tool.
