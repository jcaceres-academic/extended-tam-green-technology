Methods: This study comprehensively applied the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT), expectancy confirmation theory (ECT), and innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to analyze the data through structural equation modeling. Results: Effort expectancy (EE), facilitating condition (FC), social influence (SI), and satisfaction (SA) significantly influence medical students’ continuance intention (CI) to use artificial intelligence tools. Relative advantage (RA) has a significant impact on medical students’ satisfaction (SA) with artificial intelligence tools. Personal innovativeness (PI) plays a significant positive moderating role in the relationships between facilitating condition (FC) and continuance intention (CI), as well as between satisfaction (SA) and continuance intention (CI). Conclusions: The construction of AI-based future learning centers in medical universities should attach importance to providing personalized learning paths, ensuring technical support and training, creating a collaborative and innovative environment, and showcasing the comparative advantage of tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Expectancy confirmation theory (ECT); Future learning center; Innovation diffusion theory (IDT); Medical universities; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT)","article; artificial intelligence; diffusion of innovation; expectancy; female; human; learning; medical student; structural equation modeling; behavior; male; psychology; young adult; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Intention; Learning; Male; Students, Medical; Young Adult"

This study addresses this gap by presenting the first comprehensive examination of key factors influencing the emergence and development of TEC projects in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. The study uses an established analytical framework from previous research encompassing seven dimensions: market structure, hard- and soft institutions, financing, physical infrastructure, capacity, and interactions with other stakeholders. Data are gathered through a literature review and interviews. Results: TECs have emerged at different times in each country, shaped by contextual circumstances and diverse forms of institutional support. Elements that have supported the development of TECs are regulatory frameworks promoting DH growth, heat decarbonisation policies, economic incentives to use waste heat in plants, targeted financing mechanisms, and assistance to enhance the capacity of TECs. External factors such as high oil prices, seismic events, and recent rising energy prices have also spurred project initiation. TECs also rely on additional factors for success, including organisational and entrepreneurial abilities to engage with stakeholders, gain social acceptance, and secure commitment from community members. Involvement from local government, intermediary organisations, and private companies is crucial for TEC implementation. Among the studied countries, Danish TECs stand out as the most developed, benefiting from a stable policy environment, decades of experience with DH and TEC, and positive societal perceptions. Conversely, Dutch and German TECs face challenges because of the early stage of their heat transition, dealing with financial obstacles, underdeveloped policies, unfamiliarity with DH technology and with TECs, as well as the need for expensive infrastructure changes. Shared challenges across regions include capacity limitations in small projects and implementing cost-effective, local, and sustainable heat sources. Conclusions: In light of the study's findings, policymakers must consider establishing stable, integral and flexible policies supporting heat decarbonisation and TECs, addressing TECs' reliance on limited capacities, involving TECs in local heat municipal plans, and facilitating high DH connection rates where DH is the most cost-effective solution from a socio-economic perspective. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Diesel engines; Waste heat; Comprehensive examination; Decarbonisation; Denmark; District heating system; Energy; Heat systems; In-buildings; Key factors; Netherlands; Thermal; Cost effectiveness; analytical framework; cost analysis; electricity generation; literature review; pioneer species; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; thermal power; Germany"

Yet, user acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) challenge their adoption. This study explores factors shaping acceptance and WTP by surveying 496 respondents on attitudes toward circular water systems and maintenance preferences. In addition, 76 visitors to the KREIS-Haus, a living lab in Switzerland, were surveyed to examine the influence of direct experience with circular water and building practices. Environmental awareness emerged as the most consistent predictor of acceptance of and WTP for circular water systems, while factors including living arrangement, environmental knowledge, dwelling size, and gender were significant in specific contexts. Among the circular practices presented, the use of treated rainwater as potable water, received the highest acceptance. Practices related to the nutrient cycle, such as composting toilets and producing fertiliser from human waste, were less accepted. About half of the respondents were open to participating in gardening (47 %) and minor technical maintenance (50 %), while preferring to outsource compost toilet management. Preferences were shaped by hygiene concerns, perceived effort, and fairness in task distribution. Visiting the KREIS-Haus increased acceptance and WTP, indicating a positive effect of experiential learning. These findings highlight the importance of combining behavioural, organisational, and contextual factors to enhance acceptance. Future research should explore the structure and long-term feasibility of maintenance models and whether stated acceptance leads to actual behavioural change. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building-level water reuse; Circular water systems; User acceptance; Willingness to pay","Behavioral research; Buildings; Composting; Economics; Maintenance; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment; Building levels; Building-level water reuse; Circular water system; Living lab; Sustainable water management; Switzerland; Users' acceptance; Water reuse; Water system; Willingness to pay; Potable water; drinking water; rain; water; building; hygiene; nutrient cycling; perception; public attitude; rainwater; technology adoption; water management; water use; willingness to pay; adolescent; adoption; adult; aged; Article; awareness; behavior change; compost; composting; engagement; exercise; experiential learning; fairness; female; gardening; gender; high income country; human; knowledge; male; middle aged; nutrient cycle; personal experience; pharmaceutics; questionnaire; sample; size; social acceptance; waste water recycling; water insecurity; water supply; Willingness To Pay"

Notably, they collectively discussed about them, flooding the online information ecosystem with a sheer volume of social media posts about LLM-based chatbots. Despite research on users' reception of this equivocal technology is on the rise, it is mainly rooted in positivist and functionalist paradigms, leaving a finer-grained understanding of how early adopters collectively make sense of such novel and unfamiliar technology in dedicated online environments elusive. Drawing upon Social Representation Theory, this study employs a computationally grounded analysis of user-generated content to investigate how the social representations of LLM-based chatbots formed in online communities. Findings reveal that users, through different discursive and emotional anchoring and objectification mechanisms, represent the LLM-based chatbot as a “creative partner”, a “multistable artifact”, a “connective hackaton”, and a “technology of power”. This work contributes to the emerging literature about LLM-based chatbots acceptance by unveiling how users discursively make sense of such unfamiliar social objects, and how they renegotiate the agentic roles of both actants involved in human-chatbot interactions. It showcases an original text-mining protocol to study social representations based on social media data; and it offers managerial implications to AI service providers and policy makers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chatbots; Large-language-models; Social representation theory; Technology acceptance; Text-mining","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data mining; Online systems; Social networking (online); Chatbots; Language model; Large-language-model; Model-based OPC; Representation theory; Social media; Social representation theory; Social representations; Technology acceptance; Text-mining; artificial intelligence; information and communication technology; policy making; service provision; social behavior; social media; social network; technology adoption; theoretical study"

Despite these benefits, many individuals find it difficult to regularly attend in-person yoga classes due to factors like geographical location, physical and/or mental health status, work schedules, or personal commitments. Currently, people try to overcome these barriers by using digital technologies, accessing live or recorded yoga lessons online and watching them on common screens. However, practicing yoga via traditional 2D screens can present challenges such as difficulty in perceiving and understanding the postures, as well as feeling less engaged, motivated, and socially connected with the instructor. This paper introduces an augmented reality (AR) solution that enables individuals to participate in yoga classes with a 3D instructor appearing in real-life size and depth within their living environments. The paper evaluates the application through a user study that compares it to the traditional 2D video approach. Results demonstrate significantly higher scores in perceived empathy, behavioral involvement, technology acceptance, and intrinsic motivation with the 3D instructor. Moreover, they suggest that combining the 3D instructor with additional AR elements that guide the user has a positive effect on user’s self-competence. In discussing the findings, the paper outlines specific ways in which the application could be further improved. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented reality; Digital workout; User experience; User study; Virtual instructor; Yoga","Behavioral research; User experience; User interfaces; Virtual reality; 3d experiences; Digital workout; Growing bodies; Health benefits; Mental health; Research support; User study; Users' experiences; Virtual instructors; Yoga; Augmented reality"

Despite growing academic interest in immersive technologies, existing research has largely focused on general consumer interactions within virtual environments, with limited attention to context-specific applications such as digital exhibitions. This study addresses this gap by examining the key factors influencing consumers’ willingness to engage with digital exhibitions in the metaverse. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research commenced with a qualitative phase, in which 20 in-depth interviews were conducted. Insights from these interviews facilitated the expansion of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model, which served as the theoretical framework for this investigation. An online survey was subsequently administered to Chinese consumers, from which 283 valid responses were collected. The data analysis utilized partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), revealing the following findings: 1) effort expectancy and the trust-risk relationship significantly impact consumers’ willingness to accept digital exhibitions; 2) electronic word of mouth significantly mediates the relationships among performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and behavioural intention, underscoring its importance; and 3) high performance and social needs orientation as well as trust-related ease of use and hedonic orientation constitute the two principal configurational pathways leading to heightened behavioural intention. This study extends the UTAUT2 model to the emerging context of metaverse-based digital exhibitions, offering a refined framework for understanding consumer acceptance in immersive environments. The findings provide actionable insights for designers and marketers aiming to enhance user engagement, build trust, and strategically leverage social influence within digital exhibition—an area of increasing relevance in the digital economy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",""

While traditional training is often perceived as uninspiring and tedious, digital educational escape rooms (DEERs) are a promising tool that combines immersive, game-based learning with authentic problem scenarios to improve cybersecurity skills. Despite their growing popularity in cybersecurity education, key acceptance factors of DEERs have not been systematically investigated. This study applies the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine how perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect the intentions of target learner groups to engage with DEERs in SETA programs. A total of 217 participants, comprising trainees, students, and employees, played one randomly selected DEER from a set of three on password management, privacy and data security, and social engineering. After completion, participants evaluated the learning environment using a standardized TAM-based questionnaire. Structural equation modeling revealed that perceived usefulness was the strongest predictor of learners’ intentions to engage with DEERs. Perceived ease of use influenced engagement intention directly and indirectly by positively affecting perceived usefulness. Multigroup analysis revealed no significant differences across age, gender, professional background, or DEER scenario. These findings highlight the importance of balancing ease of use with the extent to which learners perceive the content to be meaningful, important, and relevant to their professional context in order to ensure acceptance and effective integration of DEERs into SETA programs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cybersecurity; Digital educational escape rooms; Gamification; Technology acceptance; Vocational education",""

However, barriers such as digital literacy, language diversity, and scepticism towards technology adoption persist. This study examines farmers' adoption of MAES, using survey data collected from 230 farmers in Karnataka, southern India. By developing a hybrid Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study integrates socio-economic factors influencing MAES adoption, including constructs such as personal innovativeness, technology familiarity, and economic motivation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the behavioral drivers of technology uptake. Findings highlight that, in low-experience environments where traditional livelihoods intersect with rapidly developing scientific and technical infrastructure, farmers' adoption of MAES is influenced more by interest, familiarity and perceived economic benefits than by perceived ease of use or usefulness alone. This suggests that social networks, cultural perceptions of technology, and rural economic structures play a significant role in shaping adoption patterns. The study underscores MAES potential to improve agricultural productivity and rural livelihood in South India, emphasising the need for specific policy interventions that address socio-economic disparities and enhance digital literacy while fostering collaborative efforts between policymakers, agricultural experts, and technology providers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes; Digital literacy; Intention to use; Technology transfer; Technology uptake","agricultural extension; farmers attitude; language; literacy; technology adoption; technology transfer; India; Karnataka"

This study utilised a cross-sectional survey of 384 Australian residents aged 18 to 82 (M = 42.93, SD = 15.48) to assess public perceptions and support for policies designed to enhance safety and justice in interactions between CAVs and vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists and people with disabilities. Participants evaluated 15 policies (identified through a structured, expert-informed process as a preliminary stage) across five evaluation dimensions: acceptability for improving safety within the transport system, acceptability for improving justice within the transport system, perceived improvement of safety for all VRUs, perceived improvement of justice for all VRUs, and willingness to support each policy. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and hierarchical regression models. Policies focusing on systemic improvements, such as VRU-focused infrastructure and technology enhancements, received strong public support. Public preferences align with policies promoting fairness and inclusivity, while punitive measures and VRU-burdening policies were resisted. Cluster analysis identified three groups: VRU-burdening policies (low support), VRU-centric safety policies (moderate support), and VRU-focused infrastructure and technology policies (high support). Regression analyses revealed that factors such as age, transport accessibility, and disability influenced policy support. A content analysis revealed a strong preference for prioritising public transport investment, implementing inclusive urban designs, and establishing robust ethical frameworks. The findings highlight the need for policies that prioritise VRU safety and justice in CAV deployment. Support for inclusive, non-punitive measures points to the importance of fairness and system-wide reforms.

Despite the growing global demand for medicinal plants (MPs), little is known about the behavioral mechanisms influencing farmers' adoption decisions in challenging environments like Iran. This study fills this gap by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine farmers' adoption behavior of MPs cultivation, incorporating contextual challenges as external factors. Data were collected through structured questionnaires administered to 139 randomly selected farmers and all 25 pre-identified experts with specialized knowledge and field experience in medicinal plants in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships between challenges, perceived ease of use, usefulness, and adoption behavior. The results revealed that while farmers had a positive attitude toward MPs' usefulness (mean score: 3.18/5), adoption was hindered by low perceived ease of cultivation (mean: 1.77/5). Key challenges included high production costs (ranked 1st by CV = 0.332), lack of marketing infrastructure (CV = 0.333), and technical skill gaps. Crucially, farmers’ intentions were influenced more by perceived ease (β = 0.520) than usefulness (β = 0.185), contrasting with classic TAM predictions. This highlights a disconnect between economic potential and practical feasibility in resource-scarce settings. The study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the dominance of ease-of-use over usefulness in agricultural technology adoption among low-literacy farmers; quantifying the mediating role of infrastructural and technical barriers on behavioral intentions; and providing actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize skill development and value-chain investments over purely economic incentives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural development; Cropping pattern adaptation; Farmers' intention; Structural Equation Modeling (SEM); Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)","adoption behavior; agricultural technology; cultivation; marketing; medicinal plant; public attitude; semiarid region; technology adoption; Iran; Sistan va Baluchestan"

While understanding perspectives of stakeholders is critical for technology acceptance, their knowledge and views are underrepresented in analyses on the impact of digitalization on fruit production. This research works to fill this knowledge gap by qualitatively analyzing semi-structured interviews on the impact of digitalization on sustainability challenges in fruit production with 34 stakeholders along the fruit value chain in the case study region of Lake Constance, Germany. Societal acceptance and understanding of fruit cultivation practices, restricted plant protection product use, labour availability, and biodiversity support were the main reported environmental and socio-economic challenges. Nearly all stakeholders (94%) were hopeful that digital technologies could effectively address environmental challenges in fruit production, particularly through increased efficiency, while greater uncertainties were reported for the socio-economic challenges. Perceptions of digitalization’s chances and challenges varied among individuals, fruit production systems, and farm sizes. Authors provide recommendations, including targeted support for small-scale fruit farmers and suggestions for future research activities, and emphasize the importance of factual knowledge dissemination on digitalization in fruit farming to support informed adoption choices for intended users.

The study conducts questionnaire surveys to collect opinions from the public in specific regions, and combines legal text analysis to evaluate the responsiveness and flexibility of existing laws and regulations to autonomous driving technology. The study found that the public is cautiously optimistic about autonomous vehicles, but has obvious concerns about issues such as the definition of their legal responsibilities, safety assurance mechanisms, and privacy protection. At the same time, the current laws and regulations have obvious lags in technical standards, test access, and responsibility division, and it is difficult to fully meet the needs of the rapid development of autonomous driving technology. The important contribution of this study is that it systematically combines public opinions with legal adaptability assessments for the first time, providing empirical evidence for policymakers, emphasizing that while promoting technological development, the dynamic adjustment of laws and regulations and the establishment of public communication mechanisms should be promoted simultaneously, so as to build a social and institutional environment conducive to the healthy development of autonomous driving technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",""

This study investigates the environmental, economic, political, social, and technological determinants of the efficiency and user acceptance of bike-sharing systems, with a particular focus on new free-floating models (FFBS). We collected the data by implementing a large-scale survey of 60,000 respondents in six cities worldwide, enabling in-depth cross-city comparisons. While confirming that urban bikes are predominantly used for close-distance commutes during peak hours—a phenomenon well discussed in past literature—our findings extend the existing level of technological determinism by pointing to emerging determinants of success within systems. Specifically, the study recognises that technological advancements (e.g., smartphone application design and smart route planning) significantly enhance user satisfaction and running efficiency. Besides, ecologism and health awareness are viewed as all-encompassing psychological drivers that add to previous perceptions characterised by convenience and price considerations. Notably, the report identifies variations in users' behaviour by socio-economic and geographical location, eroding homogeneity in worldwide trends toward adopting bike-sharing. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyse how the most important factors directly and indirectly affect each other, showing that technology, social aspects, and environmental issues have the biggest impact on whether people accept the system. The results yield practical policy suggestions for urban policymakers and planners, emphasising the importance of coordinated public and private strategies, user-focused infrastructure planning, and customised educational programs to facilitate sustainable, equitable urban transport systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bike-sharing system; Cities; Energy saving; Environmental research; Influencing factors","cycle transport; energy use; environmental issue; environmental research; perception; sustainable development; transportation system; urban area; urban transport"

These robots offer a range of benefits to restaurant owners, including increased productivity and a novel customer experience. However, there are barriers to adopting these technologies, including the digital literacy gap, emotional resistance, and social concerns regarding the impact of automation. Nevertheless, most existing research has focused on customer acceptance of serving robots, overlooking the perspectives of restaurant owners, who are the actual decision makers driving their adoption. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the heterogeneous preferences of customers and restaurant owners regarding serving robot types. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and latent class analysis (LCA), this study identified two segments in each group. Customers were technology-progressive (43.6 %) or technology-conservative (56.4 %); owners were interaction-oriented (60.3 %) or appearance-oriented (39.7 %). The results showed that customers generally prefer non-humanoid robots, whereas owners favor fixed-type or humanoid robots. Notably, customers were the least likely to accept humanoid robots, indicating a potential “uncanny valley” effect. These divergent preferences suggest that successfully introducing serving robots to restaurants requires a strategic alignment between customer experience and owner priorities. By comparing these two stakeholder groups, this study provides practical insights for restaurant owners and robot manufacturers seeking to facilitate the effective introduction of serving robots in customer-facing environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Choice experiment; Heterogeneous preferences; Human-robot interaction; Serving robot; Uncanny valley","Behavioral research; Decision making; Human robot interaction; Man machine systems; Sales; Choice experiments; Customer experience; Heterogeneous preference; Humanoid robot; Humans-robot interactions; Labor shortages; Latent class; Operational efficiencies; Serving robot; Uncanny valley; Anthropomorphic robots; discrete choice analysis; food market; preference behavior; robotics; stakeholder; valley"

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI's practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs. This study extends the theoretical foundations of UTAUT2 in the public sector, offering practical insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to leverage GenAI for enhanced sustainability outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ambiguity; Discretion; Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI); Policy implementation; UTAUT2 policy alignment",""

This study investigates the determinants of adopting EBs in Pakistan using the basic technology acceptance model (TAM) along with social influence, environmental concern, electricity accessibility, value, cost-benefit, and trust as additional factors. A survey questionnaire was developed to collect data from participants in Islamabad (capital city) and Azad Kashmir. The study employed a structural equation model (SEM) to identify the key factors affecting people's intention to use EBs. The study findings indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a significantly positive influence on behavioral intention to use EBs. Similarly, perceived value, cost-benefits, and trust significantly positively affect the perceived ease of using the EB. Similarly, social influence and environmental concern have a significant positive association with the perceived usefulness of adopting EB. This finding is intuitive, as people who are conscious about the environment are likely to adopt EB to protect the environment. Electricity accessibility has a negative (but insignificant) influence on the perceived usefulness of adopting EB. The finding indicates that electricity accessibility concerns in developing countries will hinder people from using EB. The study findings will help to understand key factors that can impact people's intention to use EBs and provide recommendations to transportation agencies and policymakers to enhance the adoption of EBs in Pakistan. Ultimately, the results have the potential to contribute towards sustainable transportation promotion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing country; Electric bikes (EBs) adoption; Structural equation model; Sustainable transportation; Technology acceptance model (TAM)",""

Mobility scooters have the potential to promote independence among older adults so that they can participate in society alongside reducing dependency on motor vehicles, contributing to more sustainable urban mobility solutions. However, in developing countries, existing literature reveals a gap in quantitively assessing and comparing different factors influencing their adoption, especially psychological factors, such as external shame. This study examines mobility scooter acceptance among the elderly (aged 60+), in Tehran, a large metropolitan area, and Gorgan, a small city in Iran. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with seven constructs, including the novel introduction of ""Shame,"" was assessed using data from 805 respondents through face-to-face interviews. The second part of the study measured observed heterogeneity using multi-group analysis (MGA) to examine the effects of two moderators: city size and daily physical challenges. The results highlight “Shame” as a predictor of mobility scooter acceptance, with different impacts between the two cities. In the small city, “Shame” negatively moderates other constructs, while in the large city, perceived usefulness is a more decisive predictor; suggesting that practicality holds greater sway in such contexts. These results highlight the importance of psychological factors, especially ""Shame,"" in predicting mobility scooter acceptance based on city size. In light of these findings, tailored policies and strategies are proposed to address the unique psychological and contextual barriers faced by older adults in small and large cities, advancing social equity in sustainable transportation for the elderly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equity; Mobility scooters; Multi-group analysis; Older adults transportation; Social sustainability; Structural equation modelling; Technology acceptance model",""

In Indonesia and Malaysia, e-commerce adoption among SMEs remains limited, highlighting the critical need to understand factors that facilitate or hinder digital transformation. This study addresses this gap by developing and testing an integrative model that combines the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, innovation resistance theory (IRT), and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Survey data collected from 357 SMEs were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and organizational readiness significantly enhance adoption intention, while effort expectancy, social factors, and technological context do not exert a meaningful effect. Among the barriers, value, usage, risk, and image concerns negatively impact adoption, whereas traditional barriers were not statistically supported. Notably, value barriers emerged as the most substantial deterrent, while facilitating conditions and organizational readiness were the most influential enablers. The integrated model explains 89.9% of the variance in e-commerce adoption intention, indicating a strong explanatory power. These findings suggest that improving digital infrastructure, building organizational capabilities, and addressing perceived value and usability concerns are critical for boosting SME participation in e-commerce. Policy and managerial implications include the importance of customized government initiatives, ecosystem support from platform providers, and targeted awareness programs to reduce perceived risks and increase digital engagement among SMEs. This study contributes to the e-commerce literature by offering a comprehensive framework for understanding adoption behavior and providing evidence-based recommendations for accelerating SME digital transformation in emerging markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",""

Data were collected from 520 respondents across Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives. The study explores how attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and barriers to adoption shape individuals’ intentions to adopt RETs. Results show that attitudes towards renewable energy (β = 0.092, p < 0.05), subjective norms (β = 0.125, p < 0.05), and perceived behavioral control (β = 0.124, p < 0.05) significantly influence adoption intentions, while barriers to adoption (β = 0.546, p < 0.000) negatively impact these intentions. The study highlights that while social pressures and individual perceptions of control are crucial, overcoming financial and infrastructural barriers is key to increasing RET adoption in the region. To accelerate the adoption of RETs, the study suggests financial incentives such as subsidies, low-interest loans, and tax break, particularly targeted at low-income households. Additionally, infrastructure development to improve grid connectivity and local maintenance support is necessary. The role of community-driven awareness campaigns and leveraging social norms is also emphasized to foster broader acceptance. These findings offer actionable insights for policymakers to create more effective interventions that can facilitate a transition to renewable energy in South Asia, ensuring both environmental sustainability and energy security. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption intentions; Renewable energy technologies; South Asia; Theory of Planned Behavior","alternative energy; energy planning; energy resource; household energy; infrastructural development; maintenance; planning process; policy making; sustainability; technology adoption; Bangladesh; Bhutan; India; Maldives; Nepal; Pakistan; South Asia; Sri Lanka"

Understanding the determinants of parents’ decisions to sustain the use of such tools is critical with respect to efforts to optimize software design, develop frameworks for relevant policies, and improve digital education strategies. Research methods: A theoretical model that integrates the expectation confirmation model (ECM) with the technology acceptance model (TAM) was developed to predict parents’ continuance intentions. Data collected from 276 Chinese parents were analysed via structural equation modelling (SEM) with the goal of validating the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Perceived playability, usefulness, social influence, and satisfaction significantly predict continuance intention. Expectation confirmation positively influences playability, ease of use, and satisfaction while reducing perceived risk, although it does not affect continuance decisions directly. Conclusion: Chinese parents prioritize educational efficacy and interactivity in terms of the apps used by their children; thus, developers should establish a balance between pedagogical value and engagement.

Participants were generally hesitant to fully cede control to automation. In the case of smart charging, they were resistant to deviations from their preferred battery charge (e.g., the battery not being fully charged). On the other hand, when it came to smart thermostats, respondents showed willingness to accept small deviations from their preferred room temperature. Using a hybrid choice model that combines attitudinal responses and stated preference data to capture underlying behavioral drivers, we also show how environmental concern, personal norms, social norms, and pro-environmental habits influence consumer choices.

The study objective was to use surveys and interviews in a large metropolitan area in Arizona to characterize tap water and advanced purified water acceptability, and factors contributing to (un)acceptability. Participants were recruited through a water utility email listserv for participation in an online REDCap survey and/or 1-hr Zoom interview. Surveys and interviews inquired about perceptions of tap water safety, familiarity with water reuse terms, acceptability of direct potable reuse (called “advanced water purification” in our study for consistency with state messaging), and rationales related to acceptance. Four hundred seventy-nine individuals participated in the survey, and twenty-two individuals participated in the interviews, with roughly comparable demographics for our city of interest but with slightly higher levels of household income and education. Only 36 % of survey respondents use their tap water for drinking water supplies, but (42 %) would be open to drinking advanced purified water. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2024 on risk-based thinking to evaluate how advanced purified water may compare to current drinking water safety and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis. Survey and interview participants wanted more reassurances (e.g., third party testing and opportunities for hands-on testing). Water utilities should prioritize transparent communication strategies, including sharing detailed third-party testing data and direct community engagement initiatives, to enhance public acceptance. Utilities can build trust through clear comparisons between advanced purified water and current tap water quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced water purification; Mixed methods; Public acceptance; Risk perception; Sustainability; Water reuse","Acceptance tests; Public risks; Purification; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water treatment plants; Advanced water purification; Mixed method; Potable reuse; Public acceptance; Purified water; Tap water; Water purification; Water reuse; Water safety; Water utility; Risk perception; water; arid region; comparative study; drinking water; metropolitan area; purification; risk assessment; risk perception; sustainability; urban area; water industry; water planning; water quality; water supply; water technology; water treatment; adult; aged; Article; environmental sustainability; female; health education; health outcome; health survey; household income; human; interview; major clinical study; male; waste water recycling; water insecurity; water management; Arizona; United States"

In response to this, the concept of “green banking” has emerged as a way to counteract the negative impact that banks are inflicting on the environment. However, there is little research on green banking adoption from customers’ perspectives in emerging countries, particularly Pakistan. Therefore, the current study has explored and examined the different factors that influence customers’ intention to adopt green banking and afterwards use behavior by applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. In addition, customers’ green values and collectivist culture were incorporated into the unified model to determine the most influential factor driving green banking proliferation. The study was conducted in Lahore, Pakistan, with the participation of 305 private bank customers. The empirical findings revealed that facilitating conditions and performance expectancy are the most significant driving factors for green banking proliferation, followed by emotional and conditional values, social influence, and effort expectancy. Surprisingly, a country with a 97% Muslim population believed in a collectivist national culture and a joint family system showed an insignificant moderating effect of collective culture on relationships. Bank managers, policymakers, and researchers should take into account these factors while designing and developing green banking products/services and policies to promote green banking proliferation in mainstream markets.

Caregivers often face challenges in communication, empathy, and ethical decision-making when supporting individuals with cognitive disorders. This study proposes and examines a Metaverse and Augmented Reality (AR) based educational framework that aims to immerse caregivers in first-person simulations and collaborative virtual environments to foster deeper empathy, reduce stereotypes, and enhance ethical sensitivity. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study. Participants engaged in AR and Metaverse simulations representing sensory impairments, memory loss, and ethical dilemmas common in cognitive impairment care. Data were collected through written reflection reports, instructor field notes, and semi-structured video interviews. Thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s framework was used to identify key themes from the data. Five interconnected themes emerged: Immersive Empathy (developing emotional resonance with patients’ experiences), Challenging Stereotypes (understanding behaviors as illness-driven), Metaverse Community (fostering collaboration and perspective-taking), Ethical Sensitivity (navigating moral complexities in care), and Technology Acceptance (positive user experiences with the platform). These themes demonstrate how immersive simulations combined with group engagement can deepen understanding, strengthen communication skills, and build caregivers’ ethical confidence. This study offers a unique qualitative contribution by linking immersive virtual environments to the development of real-world caregiving competencies. Unlike conventional programs, the framework integrates emotional experience, collaborative learning, and ethical reflection in a scalable and practical design. The results suggest a promising direction for training caregivers to meet the complex needs of an aging population with both skill and compassion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented reality; Caregiver training; Cognitive impairment; Empathy; Metaverse; Qualitative thematic analysis",""

These challenges are amplified by the lack of non-verbal cues and the asynchronous nature of online communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and reduced collaboration. At the same time, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality and social media offer unprecedented opportunities to bridge these gaps, enabling more effective and inclusive intercultural interactions. In regions like Saudi Arabia, where Vision 2030 emphasises internationalisation and multiculturalism in higher education, the need for tools to assess and enhance virtual intercultural competencies is particularly urgent. Addressing this need is essential for fostering inclusive learning environments, driving academic innovation and preparing educational systems for the demands of a globalised world. Objectives: This study aimed to develop and validate the Virtual Intercultural Interactions Scale (VIIS) to assess educational leaders' intercultural competencies in virtual environments. It seeks to identify key dimensions of virtual intercultural interactions, evaluate the scale's psychometric properties and explore the role of technology in enhancing intercultural understanding. Additionally, the study provides actionable insights for improving intercultural competencies in digital learning environments and establishes a theoretical framework integrating intercultural communication, diversity management and educational technology. Methods: This exploratory mixed-method study, conducted in 2024, designed and evaluated the psychometric properties of the VIIS among 600 university managers in Saudi Arabia. The study involved a qualitative phase, including interviews and a literature review, for item generation, followed by a quantitative phase to assess the scale's psychometric properties, such as validity and reliability. Additionally, the study employed Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) from a network perspective to further examine the construct's structure and ensure its robustness. This comprehensive approach ensured the development of a reliable and valid tool to assess virtual intercultural interactions in educational leadership. Results and Conclusions: The results identified six key factors: Intercultural Dialogue, Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation, Acceptance of Cultural Diversity, Experiences and Emotions, Cultural Challenges and Cultural Learning and Development. These factors collectively explained 60.9% of the total variance of the VIIS, demonstrating its robust structural stability and suitability for assessing virtual intercultural interactions. The findings indicated that the VIIS provides a reliable tool for shaping educational policies and practices in multicultural settings like Saudi Arabia and holds potential for broader application across diverse cultural and geographical contexts. Additionally, this scale is handy for designing professional development programs and training initiatives for educational leaders, focusing on enhancing intercultural competencies through advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality and digital communication tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital learning environments; educational leaders; intercultural interactions; psychometrics; technology-driven approach; virtual communication",""

Traditional studies often overlook gender differences, complicating the identification of complex causal relationships and multi-level pathways in virtual environments.This study employs PLS-SEM to: (1) examine the relationship between the attributes of virtual gear (scarcity, brand symbolic value, visibility, identity satisfaction and social recognition) and conspicuous consumption behaviour, with social recognition acting as a mediator; (2) determine the moderating role of emotional affordance and technology acceptance; (3) analyse gender differences in the impact pathways; and (4) utilise fsQCA to identify causal configurations associated with high conspicuous consumption behaviour. Using 550 valid samples, reliability and validity tests confirmed the robustness of the Stimulus-Organism-Response model. PLS-SEM analysis indicates that the attributes of virtual gear positively influence conspicuous consumption behaviour. However, technology acceptance does not moderate the effect of social recognition on conspicuous consumption behaviour (r = 0.014, p > 0.05), and neither brand symbolic value nor social recognition exhibits a chain mediation effect on the influence of virtual gear product scarcity on conspicuous consumption behaviour (r = 0.009, p > 0.05). Furthermore, six groups of pathways demonstrate significant gender differences. The fsQCA analysis reveals that virtual gear product scarcity and brand symbolic value are key factors in the three configurations of high conspicuous consumption behaviour. These findings provide theoretical insights for sustainable marketing strategies on virtual platforms and practical guidance for promoting rational consumption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conspicuous consumption behaviour; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; Gender differences; Metaverse marketing strategies; PLS-SEM analysis; Virtual gear product attributes","consumption behavior; electronic commerce; gender relations; marketing; symbolism; technology adoption"

This study examines emission mitigation strategies within the sector through the lens of a PESTEL framework, analyzing political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal dimensions. Key findings highlight the pivotal role of international regulations, such as MARPOL Annex VI and the EU maritime regulations, alongside national incentives in accelerating the adoption of alternative fuels and advanced emission reduction technologies. Economically, while measures like slow steaming offer immediate cost savings, technologies such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen propulsion require substantial investment and infrastructure development. Social acceptance, workforce training, and public perception of alternative fuels emerge as critical factors in enabling industry-wide adoption. The study further explores technological challenges related to scalability and lifecycle emissions, emphasizing the need for coordinated innovation and investment. Environmental impacts, particularly on biodiversity and well-to-wake emissions, underscore the importance of regulatory oversight and sustainable fuel production. Legally, the industry faces complex compliance requirements, liability risks, and evolving insurance frameworks. By adopting a strategic and collaborative approach, the maritime sector can navigate these multifaceted challenges to achieve its decarbonization goals.

However, their acceptance remains low, particularly in emerging markets like Armenia, where issues of public trust and perception pose significant barriers. This study aims to examine behavioral intents to embrace autonomous vehicles by extending the Technology Acceptance Model with trust, social influence, and user attitudes. The study employs a dual analytical method, including structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, to find both linear and configurational pathways that influence adoption intentions. The results of structural equation modeling show that trust highly affects behavioral intention, both directly and indirectly through perceived usefulness and attitudes. In addition, social influence moderates the relationships, particularly those between perceived ease of use and attitude, as well as trust and intention. The results of fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis reveal multiple sufficient combinations of factors leading to high behavioral intention. Attitude emerged as a central factor in most configurations that indicated a strong intention to adopt. This study increases our understanding of how social and cognitive factors influence the adoption of autonomous vehicles. It highlights the importance of building trust and improving the usability of the design to generate positive perceptions and a desire to utilize it.

To promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive urban mobility, understanding and predicting the behaviors of pedestrians and cyclists, including their intentions, decisions, and movements, when they interact with autonomous systems becomes crucial. Gaining a thorough understanding of these complex interactions can not only improve the safety, efficiency, and acceptance of autonomous systems but also enhance the design and implementation of these technologies. Through a comprehensive review of the literature spanning the years 2014 to 2023, we identify 99 articles that empirically investigate the interactions of humans and autonomous systems. Based on our overview of progress and challenges within this field, we further identify five research gaps that future research should address to enhance human-autonomous system interactions, including: (1) scaling up experimental scenarios to multi-user and multi-modal setups to better represent real-world challenges, (2) emphasizing safety-critical scenarios that are difficult to achieve in real-world environments by applying virtual reality, (3) incorporating diverse behavioral data from the human perspective to deepen the understanding of vulnerable road user behavior and decisions, (4) embracing continuous and real-time interaction to better predict dynamic future environments, and (5) enhancing the generalization ability to ensure realism and broad applicability.

Electric autonomous shuttles can enhance accessibility and energy efficiency of public transportation used by older riders. Little is known about potential users' and transportation service providers’ perceptions of the factors influencing use of shared autonomous vehicles by older adults, particularly those in regions with extreme weather. Research design and methods: In this qualitative study, adults aged 60 years and older and service providers (e.g., administrators, staff) from local mobility organizations involved in supporting transportation services used by older adults participated in focus groups or individual interviews about community mobility and use of public transit, as well as their knowledge, beliefs, and understanding of shared autonomous shuttles. Data collection and analyses were informed using an adapted version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology-2. Results: Sixteen older adults and nine service providers participated. Findings suggest older adults’ perceptions and potential use of autonomous shuttles can be influenced by tiered and intersecting factors within the following contextual concepts: (1) Rider Characteristics (Micro-level); (2) The Envisioned Autonomous Shuttle (Meso-level); (3) Features of the Local Context (Macro-level); and (4) Societal Discourses (Mega-level). Discussion and implications: Autonomous shuttles have the potential to be feasibly integrated into current public transportation systems. Such integration should consider vehicle and service design, including policies and implementation, built environment infrastructure, and public awareness of autonomous shuttle function to meet older adult needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bus; Focus groups; Older adults; Paratransit; Self-driving; Transit",""

Enhancing such engagement is a critical factor for any leader seeking to develop a positive work environment and performance within the organization. The study explores the intricate relationship between communicative leadership and employee engagement, with a focal mediating variable of how employees perceive communication. Building on the technology acceptance model (TAM), which emphasizes perceived usefulness and ease of use, the current study also evaluated the potential moderating impact of leader intention to use ChatGPT between communicative leadership and employee engagement, as well as between communicative leadership and employee’s perception of communication. A survey distributed to public sector employees in Fiji Island yielded a response of 345 participants through cross-sectional and purposive sampling. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to determine the model fit. The findings of the study show that communicative leaders significantly enhance employee engagement through employee's perception of communication. This suggests that when employees perceived leader communication well, they are more likely to engage in collaborative decision-making and demonstrate greater mutual obligation and commitment in the organization. Additionally, by encouraging dialogues, communicative leaders establish a safe environment where employees feel comfortable expressing their voice ensuring they are listened to and valued. Based on TAM factors, the leader’s intention to use ChatGPT partially moderates the relationship. This suggests that having perceived AI technology as user-friendly, leaders could leverage ChatGPT to streamline the flow of communication and provide a real-time solution.

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative research design was used, using survey data to examine the influence of perceived usefulness (PU), ease of use (EU) and top management commitment (TMC) on AI adoption readiness (AIAR) in auditing. A conceptual model, drawing from the technology acceptance model (TAM) and supported by findings from previous literature, was proposed. The model was tested using partial least squares – structural equation modelling on data collected from 116 Moroccan respondents. Findings – The study confirmed that PU and TMC do not significantly influence the AIAR in auditing in Morocco, whereas EU is positively and significantly associated to the AIAR. Research limitations/implications – The study presents findings based on data from a single country, which may limit the broader applicability of the results to other contexts or regions with different regulatory, cultural or economic environments. Practical implications – The results suggest that TAM is not necessarily adapted to AI adoption within an emerging context like Morocco. The significant role of EU in AIAR suggests that Moroccan firms should prioritize the development and integration of AI tools that are intuitive and user-friendly. AI should be presented not only as a tool for enhancing audit quality but also as a means of reducing workload and improving efficiency. Furthermore, rather than relying solely on top-down mandates, a more decentralized approach to AI adoption could be effective, where individual auditors are empowered to experiment with AI tools and integrate them into their practices. This approach could foster a culture of innovation and gradual adoption, increasing the likelihood of successful AI integration within Moroccan auditing firms. Social implications – AI adoption in auditing can promote societal benefits by enhancing transparency, accountability and trust in both public and private sectors. In countries like Morocco, where financial transparency is lacking but vital for stability, AI can help reduce corruption, improve decision-making and foster public trust, ultimately supporting investment and social equity. Originality/value – This paper offers an original contribution by examining AIAR in Morocco’s auditing sector, focusing on an emerging market and African context. Unlike studies in developed countries, it highlights the unique challenges and opportunities faced by Moroccan auditors, considering factors like PU, EU and TMC.

Although AI is increasingly used in educational settings, its role in handling academic mediation, where ethical sensitivity, empathy, and trust are essential, remains underexplored. To fill this gap, this study presents a model that integrates Media Richness Theory, Social Presence Theory, Technology Acceptance Models, and Trust Theory, incorporating digital fluency and conflict ambiguity as key moderating elements. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, the research involves 287 students from a variety of academic institutions. The quantitative findings indicate that students’ willingness to adopt AI mediation tools is significantly influenced by automation, efficiency, and trust, while their perceptions are shaped by how clearly the conflict is understood and by students’ digital skills. The qualitative insights reveal concerns about emotional responsiveness, transparency, and institutional capacity. According to the results, user trust rooted in perceived presence, fairness, and emotional connection is a central factor in terms of AI acceptance, and emotionally aware, transparent, algorithmic and context-sensitive design strategies should be a system-level priority for institutions when integrating AI mediation tools into academic environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; conflict resolution; higher education; leadership communication; social presence","Behavioral research; Decision making; Education computing; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Students; Conflict Resolution; Decisions makings; Educational settings; High educations; Higher education institutions; Intention to use; Leadership communication; Media richness theory; Social presence; University students; Artificial intelligence"

However, a single-entity governance model reduces the management efficiency of smart communities and hinders the realization of fitness-health integration within them. A collaborative governance model involving governments, businesses, social organizations, and residents replaces the traditional linear governance model that relies on a single entity through resource integration. This study, based on collaborative governance theory, employs three scenario-based experimental designs and quantitative analysis, with Xiamen’s smart city community and non-smart urban village community as research subjects. It explores the multistakeholder collaborative governance model for the deep integration of fitness and health, compares the differences in fitness-health integration between smart communities and non-smart communities, and measures the effectiveness differences between multistakeholder collaborative governance and single-entity governance models. The findings indicate: (1) Residents in smart communities have higher satisfaction with comprehensive fitness-health services; (2) Residents in smart communities perceive shorter psychological distances when engaging in fitness-health activities compared to non-smart environments; (3) The governance model moderates the impact of psychological distance on service satisfaction. Compared to the single-actor model, multiactor collaborative governance more effectively enhances perceived psychological proximity and improves satisfaction.

How to effectively leverage GenAI to support instructional design has thus become a critical issue in teacher education. While existing studies have validated the technical potential and functional value of GenAI in instructional design, there remains a notable gap in qualitative investigations into pre-service teachers’ subjective willingness to adopt GenAI and its underlying influencing factors. To address this gap, this present study employed grounded theory to explore the factors that shape pre-service teachers’ intention to use GenAI for instructional design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 pre-service teachers from Shaanxi Normal University, and the data were analyzed through open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. A theoretical model comprising four major dimensions was developed as follows: (1) technical factors (relative advantage and ease of use), (2) environmental factors (social impact, opinion leader, and facilitating conditions), (3) usage characteristics (purpose of use and method of use), and (4) psychological factors (trust, perceived risk, and a professional self-concept). The findings reveal that pre-service teachers’ intention to use GenAI is not shaped by a single factor but is instead the result of dynamic and interrelated interactions among the four dimensions. This study extends current technology acceptance theories and offers practical insights for the effective integration and promotion of GenAI in instructional design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","GenAI; grounded theory; instructional design; pre-service teachers; usage intention","anxiety; Article; clinical article; creativity; data interpretation; environmental factor; female; generative artificial intelligence; grounded theory; human; male; natural language processing; psychological aspect; social influence; structured questionnaire; teacher; teacher training; theoretical model; Theory of Planned Behavior"

This research employs the Hesitant Fuzzy Best–Worst Method (HF-BWM) to systematically identify and prioritise the institutional, technological, sociocultural, and legal issues affecting cross-border e-business operations. This study combines Transaction Cost Theory (TCT), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Commitment–Trust Theory to create a comprehensive framework for analysing the interplay of these risks and their effects on transaction costs and company sustainability. The findings indicate that institutional risks constitute the most substantial obstacles, with deficient digital transaction legislation and inadequate data governance recognised as the principal drivers of uncertainty and increased transaction costs. The research indicates that these institutional challenges necessitate immediate focus, as they immediately affect corporate operations, especially in international digital commerce. Technological risks, such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities, insufficient IT skills, and deficiencies in digital infrastructure, were identified as the second most critical factors, leading to considerable operational disruptions and heightened expenses. Sociocultural hazards, such as language difficulties and varying consumer behaviours, were recognised as moderate concerns that, although significant, exert a weaker cumulative impact than technological and institutional challenges. Eventually, legal risks, especially concerning cybercrime legislation and the protection of intellectual property, were identified as substantial complicators of e-business activities, increasing the intricacy of legal compliance and cross-border contract enforcement. The results underscore the imperative for regulatory reforms, investments in cybersecurity, and methods for cultural adaptation to alleviate the identified risks and promote sustainable growth in China–West Africa e-business relationships. This study offers practical insights for governments, business leaders, and investors to effectively manage the intricate risk landscape and make educated decisions that foster enduring collaboration and trust between China and West Africa in digital trade. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Best-Worst Method (BWM); China-West Africa cooperation; digital trade; e-business supply chain; Manhattan distance; technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)",""

However, the effective integration of these technologies requires a nuanced understanding of the factors that influence user adoption. This study investigates the key determinants affecting the adoption of metaverse technology within higher education institutions in Jordan. The study uses a hybrid model that combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the Information Culture Theory(ICT). Data were collected using structured questionnaires from a stratified sample of 383 students at two Jordanian universities. Data were analyzed using a two-stage analytical framework: structural equation modelling (SEM) via SmartPLS 4 and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results showed that Performance Expectancy, Hedonic Motivation, Cultural Attitudes, Information Integrity, Personal Innovativeness, and Perceived Privacy had medium-sized, statistically significant positive effects on behavioral intention to adopt Metaverse technology. In contrast, perceived risks have emerged as notable inhibitors of behavioral intention to use, underscoring the urgent need to alleviate users' concerns about data security and the potential negative consequences of adopting this technology. Furthermore, the study emphasized the importance of social and cultural structures, as cultural attitudes towards change and innovation significantly influence adoption behavior. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","(UTAUT2); information culture theory; Metaverse; technology adoption",""

Although existing digital meditation applications offer valuable basic guidance, they often lack interactivity, real-time personalized feedback, and dynamic simulation of real-life scenarios necessary for comprehensive experiential training applicable to daily stressors. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel immersive meditation system specifically designed for deployment within a metaverse environment. The system provides mindfulness practice through two distinct modules within the virtual world. The experience-based module delivers AI-driven social interactions within simulated everyday scenarios, with narrative content dynamically generated by large language models (LLMs), followed by guided inner reflection, thereby forming a scenario–experience–reflection cycle. The breathing-focused module provides real-time feedback through a breath-synchronization interface to enhance respiratory awareness. The feasibility and preliminary effects of this metaverse-based system were explored in a two-week, single-group, pre-test/post-test study involving 31 participants. The participants completed a battery of validated psychological questionnaires assessing psychological distress, mindfulness, acceptance, self-compassion, and self-esteem before and after engaging in the intervention.

Technological advancements over the past decade have brought private autonomous vehicles, particularly those defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers Levels 4 and 5, into focus as promising solutions for mitigating road congestion and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent to which Autonomous Vehicles can fulfill this potential depends largely on user acceptance, patterns of use, and their integration within broader green energy and sustainability policies. The present paper aims to develop an integrated conceptual model that links behavioral determinants to environmental outcomes, assessing how individuals’ intention to adopt private autonomous vehicles can contribute to sustainable urban mobility. The model integrates five psychosocial determinants—perceived usefulness, trust in technology, social influence, environmental concern, and perceived behavioral control—with contextual variables such as energy source, infrastructure availability, and public policy. These components interact to predict users’ intention to adopt AVs and their perceived contribution to urban sustainability. Methodologically, the study builds on a narrative synthesis of the literature and proposes a framework applicable to empirical validation through structural equation modeling (SEM). The model draws on established frameworks such as Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behavior, and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, incorporating constructs including perceived usefulness, trust in technology, social influence, environmental concern, and perceived behavioral control, constructs later to be examined in relation to key contextual variables, including the energy source powering Autonomous Vehicles—such as electricity from mixed or renewable grids, hydrogen, or hybrid systems—and the broader policy environment (regulatory frameworks, infrastructure investment, fiscal incentives, and alignment with climate and mobility strategies and others). The research provides relevant directions for public policy and behavioral interventions in support of the development of clean and smart urban transport in the age of automation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autonomous vehicles; behavioral intentions; environmental impact; structural equation modeling; sustainable urban mobility; technology acceptance",""

This study investigates the potential of 360° VR storytelling to enhance learning through embodied knowledge, attitudinal change, and emotional awareness. Conducted within the EMOTIONAL project, the research explores a first-person narrative told from the perspective of a ceramic object rooted in Italian cultural heritage, designed to facilitate meaningful, affective learning. The present study addresses the following research questions: RQ1 Can 360° VR story-living narrations effectively promote embodied learning and semantic and attitudinal shifts in the context of sustainability education? RQ2 What added insights can be gained from integrating subjective assessments with physiological measures? To this end, a hybrid assessment framework was developed and validated, combining subjective self-report tools (including attitudinal scales, semantic differential analysis, and engagement metrics) with objective physiological measures, specifically Electrodermal Activity (EDA). Sixty participants, including students and entrepreneurs, experienced the immersive narrative, and a subset underwent physiological tracking to evaluate the effectiveness of the experience. The findings show that immersive storytelling can enhance emotional and cognitive engagement, producing shifts in semantic interpretation, self-perceived knowledge, and attitudes toward material culture. A convergence of high emotional engagement, embodied learning, and technology acceptance was observed, although individual differences emerged based on prior experience and disciplinary background. EDA data offered complementary insights, identifying specific moments of heightened arousal during the narrative. The study demonstrates that emotionally driven immersive narratives (supported by integrated assessment methods) can make abstract sustainability values more tangible and personally resonant, thereby fostering more reflective and relational approaches to sustainable consumption and production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrodermal Activity; embodied knowledge; hybrid assessment framework; immersive learning; immersive storytelling design; sustainability education; virtual reality","education; integrated approach; learning; sustainability; traditional knowledge; virtual reality"

However, its success depends on farmers’ acceptance, influenced by perceptions of economic benefits, social acceptability, environmental impacts, and health risks. This study surveys 391 farmers across five regions in Saudi Arabia to assess their attitudes toward TWW reuse in irrigation, exploring how advanced wastewater treatment technologies can improve acceptance. Results show that 65% of farmers use TWW, with usage peaking at 72% in Al-Ahsa and Qatif, driven by water scarcity and lack of alternatives. While 78% are satisfied with TWW, concerns persist regarding pests, consumer acceptance, health risks, and soil quality. Advanced technologies can mitigate these issues by enhancing water quality and safety. The highest positive impact of the use of TWW in irrigation from was the impact on productivity, reduction in the cost of fertilizers and savings in the cost of water abstraction. With only 57% of farmers receiving extension services, integrating education on these technologies could further boost confidence. This study highlights key acceptance factors, underscoring the need for technological and educational interventions to promote sustainable TWW reuse in agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agricultural irrigation; farmers’ attitudes; sustainability; treated wastewater; water scarcity","agricultural practice; arid region; education; farmers attitude; irrigation system; sustainability; wastewater treatment; water management; water quality; Al-Ahsa; Eastern Province [Saudi Arabia]; Saudi Arabia"

Rooted in ethical considerations, our approach defines four core behavior-guided design strategies: routine recovery, emotion-responsive adjustment, behavioral transition induction, and external linkage. Each strategy is meticulously translated into a detailed system logic that outlines input conditions, trigger thresholds, and feedback outputs, designed for implementability with ambient sensing technologies. Through a comparative conceptual analysis of three sensing configurations—low-resolution LiDARs, mmWave radars, and environmental sensors—we evaluate their suitability based on technical feasibility, spatial integration, operationalized privacy metrics, and ethical alignment. Supported by preliminary technical observations from lab-based sensor tests, low-resolution LiDAR emerges as the most balanced option for its ability to offer sufficient behavioral insight while enabling edge-based local processing, robustly protecting privacy, and maintaining compatibility with compact residential settings. Based on this, we present a working three-layered system architecture emphasizing edge processing and minimal-intrusion feedback mechanisms. While this paper primarily focuses on the framework and design aspects, we also outline a concrete pilot implementation plan tailored for small-scale home environments, detailing future empirical validation steps for system effectiveness and user acceptance. This structured design logic and pilot framework lays a crucial foundation for future applications in diverse residential and care contexts, facilitating longitudinal observation of behavioral patterns and iterative refinement through lived feedback. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader discourse on how technology can ethically and developmentally support children’s autonomy and well-being, moving beyond surveillance to enable subtle, ambient, and socially responsible spatial interactions attuned to children’s everyday lives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavior-guided system; child-behavior; design strategy; LiDAR; sensor","Behavioral research; Computer architecture; Ethical technology; Feedback; Iterative methods; Behavior-guided system; Child-behavior; Design strategies; Domestic environments; Guided system; LiDAR; Lower resolution; Non-intrusive; Spatial systems; Structured design; Housing; child; child behavior; home environment; human; physiology; Child; Child Behavior; Home Environment; Humans"

Traditional studies have used questionnaires to assess social acceptance, but these have limitations. To gather more reliable data, tracking physiological signals offers a promising alternative. This study aims to develop and test an experimental protocol to assess human acceptance of autonomous driving by using both objective measures - i.e.: Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Skin Potential Response (SPR), and Eye Tracking (ET) - and subjective measures, by means of surveys. The tests were conducted in a controlled yet realistic environment using the VI-Grade DiM400 dynamic driving simulator. The study involved 31 participants who acted as passengers in a vehicle driven either by a human driver or by different human-like driver models across three driving scenarios. Various indices were extracted from each biosignal, and a repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess differences in participants’ emotional states between human and autonomous driving, as well as during specific driving events. The ANOVA results indicated that the setup effectively captured changes in emotional state during events, with ECG time domain indices being particularly sensitive. However, no significant differences were found in the cognitive state between human and autonomous driving, suggesting a consistently relaxed state across conditions — a finding also supported by the questionnaires. This study demonstrates the potential of using ECG signals to objectively measure emotional responses in driving scenarios, providing valuable insights into trust in autonomous vehicles and offering new possibilities for driving safety and monitoring applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous driving; Dynamic driving simulator; Experimental protocol; Physiological signals",""

Our findings confirm the presence of a NIMBY effect on renewables, with landscape considerations emerging as a key factor. However, targeted communication about climate benefits and local financial gains, as well as implementing smaller-scale projects, significantly reduces resistance.

Despite their potential, recent research indicates that these technological advancements might contribute to feelings of job insecurity, prompting employees to consider alternative employment. Understanding how healthcare personnel view their job prospects considering robotic technology is crucial for ensuring that their implementation lessens rather than exacerbates workforce challenges in the sector. To explore this, we draw on literatures in management and human-technology interaction to hypothesize how the social work environment and perceptions of robot technology can influence healthcare workers’ technology-related job insecurity. Our study involved a cross-sectional survey conducted with healthcare staff at a Norwegian rehabilitation hospital (N = 56) during a feasibility assessment of a humanoid robot for assisting in non-medical tasks. We used regression analysis with bootstrapping and found that perceptions of technology-related job insecurity were generally low. Team climate and beliefs regarding robot technology significantly explained 19% of variance in technology-related job insecurity. Higher perceived usefulness of the humanoid robot was related with increased perceptions of technology as a threat. This belief was, in turn, informed by general trust in the performance capabilities of robots. Our findings suggest that recognizing robots as useful can intensify perceptions of job insecurity amongst healthcare workers. Contrary to expectations, experiencing their work environment as promoting employee participation was not related to their threat perceptions. We discuss these findings and strategies for mitigating technology-related job insecurity for successful integration of robots in healthcare. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Healthcare; Job insecurity; Perceptions of robots; Robot acceptance; Robot adoption; Technology threat","Anthropomorphic robots; Employment; Human resource management; Job satisfaction; Regression analysis; Healthcare; Healthcare workers; Humanoid robot; Job insecurity; Perception of robot; Robot acceptances; Robot adoption; Robot technology; Technology threat; Work environments; Health care"

A combination of quantitative and qualitative social research methods was used to collect perspectives from residents and stakeholders both near and distant from mining areas. Results indicate that mining regions generally show higher acceptance due to economic dependency and cultural ties, though concerns persist. Urban respondents, while recognizing mining's economic value, emphasized ethical and environmental issues. EO technologies were met with skepticism, reflecting broader distrust of new technologies and media. Many respondents were unaware of EO technologies and their potential mining applications. Although transparency was valued, EO was not seen as vital for public engagement.

The study employs a quantitative approach, analysing 358 online surveys from UK hotel guests using AMOS-SEM. The findings reveal that performance expectancy and effort expectancy influence attitudes. However, performance expectancy does not directly impact intentions and effort expectancy was found to significantly affect intention in a negative manner. Also, the social influence, facilitating conditions, anthropomorphism, aesthetics, and trust significantly affect intentions to use robots. Moreover, attitude mediates the relationship between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and behavioural intentions.

Gasification could help to reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports and, depending upon the feedstock used, could help to decarbonise and improve the circularity of the sector. Despite the importance that public acceptance can have for the roll-out of industrial technologies, studies into public attitudes and risk perceptions of gasification technology are lacking. To address this gap, the current study investigated public attitudes towards two forms of gasification (coal and waste gasification) using an online survey distributed to demographically representative samples of the public from the UK, Germany and China. The objectives were to: (1) gain insight into public attitudes towards the use of gasification technologies in these countries; (2) assess potential divergence in public attitudes towards the use of different carbon sources within gasification; and (3) identify the potential impact of negative social framing – namely the Nasty Effect – on risk perceptions. Results showed that attitudes towards gasification were generally positive in all three countries, although significantly more so in China. The anticipated preference for waste gasification was observed in the UK and Germany but not in China. There was little consistent evidence of the Nasty Effect in terms of participants’ evaluations of the technological and environmental risks of gasification in each country. The results hold potential implications for the development of future outreach and communication activities relating to the technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communication; Gasification; Nasty effect; Public attitudes; Risk perception; Technology acceptance","Chemical production; Gasification technologies; Industrial scale; Industrial-technology; Nasty effect; Oil and natural gas; Public acceptance; Public attitudes; Technology acceptance; Waste gasification; alternative energy; circular economy; emission control; public attitude; risk perception; technology adoption; China; Germany; United Kingdom"

Moderation analysis reveals that firm size amplifies the effects of performance expectancy, lean thinking, facilitating conditions, innovation cost, and social influence on adoption intention, while sustainability concern does not show a significant impact. Moreover, behavioural intention robustly forecasts actual adoption behaviour. These results underscore the need for robust digital infrastructure and integrated lean management practices, together with cost-effective strategies, to drive digital transformation in Pakistan’s textile sector.

However, the success of DAC deployment hinges not only on technological advancements but also on social acceptance. This study investigates the psychological and socio-economic determinants influencing public preferences for DAC-U (Direct Air Capture and Utilization) technology in Japan, utilizing a nationwide survey of 3139 respondents. Through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we uncover that technology acceptance and environmental awareness are critical drivers of DAC-U preferences, with both technology acceptance and environmental awareness having a direct effect. Environmental awareness, meanwhile, indirectly amplifies DAC-U preferences by enhancing technology acceptance, highlighting a dual-pathway influence. The findings also reveal significant demographic and living condition factors, such as age, education, home ownership, and energy costs, shaping these preferences. Surprisingly, older individuals demonstrate higher technology acceptance but lower environmental awareness, reflecting diverse motivations across demographic groups. The study emphasizes tailored policy interventions to boost DAC-U adoption, including targeted subsidies, demonstration projects in high-energy-cost regions, and age-specific outreach strategies. By addressing both practical and environmental concerns, this research offers actionable insights into accelerating the integration of DAC-U into the carbon neutrality roadmap, providing a robust foundation for global sustainability efforts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Direct air capture and utilization (DAC-U); Environmental awareness; Social acceptance; Structural equation modeling (SEM); Technology acceptance","Carbon; Direct air capture; Economics; Population statistics; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Air captures; Carbon neutralities; Direct air capture and utilization; Environmental awareness; Public acceptance; Social acceptance; Socio-economics; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation models; Technology acceptance; Environmental technology"

The study introduces the Ethical Personalisation Nudging Model (EPNM), which builds on TAM by integrating autonomy-supportive design principles from Self-Determination Theory and ethical evaluation based on Beauchamp and Childress’ principlist framework. This framework, focusing on autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, was utilised to evaluate the moral legitimacy of nudging strategies. Results show that personalised digital nudges increased responsible gaming behaviour by 37% (p < 0.01), improved perceived trust by 28% (p < 0.05), and decreased excessive playtime by an average of 1.2 hours daily. The model demonstrated particularly significant effects among younger users (β = 0.45, p < 0.001), highlighting demographic differences in the response to nudges.

Existing models, such as the technology–organization–environment (TOE) model, highlight systemic drivers and barriers but overlook the individual-level factors that are also critical to successful adoption. To address this gap, we propose a decision model that combines the TOE model with the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and combines the dimensions of technology, organization, environment, and individual readiness. The model was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and supports group decision-making by combining the pairwise comparison matrices of multiple experts into a consolidated priority structure. Specifically, many expert judgments were used to create a group matrix for the four main categories and four additional group matrices for the criteria within each category. This structured approach allows for a systematic assessment of whether a public sector organization is ready for AI adoption. The results show the importance of both systemic factors (such as data, technology, innovation, and readiness for change) and individual factors (such as social influence and voluntariness of use).

Emerging social sensor-based technology and measurement provide an opportunity to enhance IP-Sim. Using these methods, signals generated by team members in action are collected, analyzed, and presented in a debriefing session as visual aids and statistics that summarize behavioral markers of teamwork and taskwork. We developed a novel social sensor-based measuring system and tested it in a pilot study to demonstrate its feasibility, acceptance, and relevance during IP-sim in CRM Methods During 6 immersive scenario-based IP-Sim sessions, we gathered both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (videotaped debriefing) postsimulation exposure data. Six experimental teams, each containing 3 trainees (2 nurses and 1 physician), were involved in a scenario in which a life-threatening emergency in a hospital setting had to be identified and managed. Results By conducting successful deployment in a simulated environment, we demonstrated the viability of the proposed system and outlined the remaining obstacles (feasibility check). We documented users' successful and unsuccessful methods for incorporating the solution into existing training frameworks (acceptability check). In addition, we determined how users interpreted behavioral markers during debriefing such as space occupation, gaze dynamics, and verbal interaction to improve situational awareness and common understanding (relevance check).

The shift towards paperless examinations is vital for sustainability and efficiency in education, yet understanding the determinants of student adoption remains a challenge. To address this, the study collected data from 480 undergraduate students from Jharkhand and Karnataka, India, and the proposed model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and hedonic motivations (HM) significantly influence students’ behavioral intentions to use digital exam pads, which in turn positively affect actual usage behavior (UB). Additionally, gender was found to moderate the relationship between HM and BI. The study concludes that the UTAUT model effectively explains digital exam pad adoption, offering practical insights for universities aiming to implement such technologies. The findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to enhance student engagement with digital tools, particularly considering gender differences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital exam pad; Higher education; Paperless exam; PLS-SEM; UTAUT",""

One representative application is AI-based creativity support tools (CSTs), which have the potential to streamline the creative process and enhance productivity. However, few studies have focused on the adoption of AI-CSTs. In this context, a model is constructed to clarify the mechanism of user acceptance for AI-CSTs in China’s creative industries. The proposed model includes four variables from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and six additional variables. We carried out a questionnaire survey and obtained responses from 435 individuals with experience or interest in AI-CSTs in China. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed for data analysis. The results showed that user acceptance of AI-CSTs might be affected by three UTAUT variables (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence), two risk-specific variables (ethical concern and privacy concern), and one contextual variable (regulatory environment). Two user demand variables (interactivity and personalization) seemed to have direct influences on effort expectancy. In summary, this paper proposes a model by extending UTAUT and then verifies the explanatory power of UTAUT in the context of AI-CSTs in China’s creative industries. In addition, the proposed strategies can provide valuable insights and benefit different stakeholders in creative industries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Behavior intentions; Creativity support tool; Human‒computer interaction; Technology acceptance",""

The United States has only one Li mine and commercial refinery, and one Li-byproduct producer in 2024. Projects from exploration to production are classified in four production types: hard-rock mining of Li pegmatites, soft-rock mining of Li clays and sediments, and solution mining of Li brines through evaporative concentration or direct lithium extraction (DLE). This contribution reviews all major U.S. lithium projects to total known (mid 2024) reserves of 0.71 Mt and resources of 27.8 Mt (million metric tonnes contained lithium). Upon this foundation, the political ecology of Li development is analyzed, focused on interconnected environmental impacts and social perceptions. Lithium pegmatite deposits (12 % of reserves; 2 % of resources) have seen open pit mining proposals raise concerns over water quality and landscape disruption. From Li clays and sediments (71 % of reserves; 74 % of resources) controversies have developed over Tribal cultural resources and potential impacts on desert playa ecosystems. Salar-type brines (10 % of reserves; 1 % of resources) supply the sole Li mine through evaporative concentration. High water usage in this method has led to research and development of DLE methods that may enable lithium recovery from geothermal brines and oilfield brines (11 % and 6 % of resources respectively). A summary conceptual diagram of the lithium landscape, highlights interconnected global, domestic, and site-specific factors necessary for responsible U.S. lithium production.

This study explores the impact of preschool inclusive teachers' cognition of traditional culture on their digital literacy, as well as the chain-mediating role of technology acceptance and job insecurity in this relationship. Through a questionnaire survey, valid data were collected from 500 teachers in 40 preschool inclusive kindergartens. The study specifically focuses on teachers' cognition of traditional cultural values, customs, and practices. The theoretical foundation of this research is derived from cultural cognition theory and the technology acceptance model. The results indicate that preschool inclusive teachers' cognition of traditional culture has a significant positive impact on their digital literacy. Furthermore, traditional cultural cognition has an indirect effect on job insecurity, which influences the relationship between traditional culture and digital literacy. Technology acceptance serves as the first mediating variable between traditional cultural cognition and digital literacy, playing a crucial transmitting role. Meanwhile, job insecurity acts as the second mediating variable in this relationship. Together, technology acceptance and job insecurity form a chain-mediating effect in the relationship between traditional cultural cognition and digital literacy. Based on these findings, we propose recommendations such as constructing a cultural context, emphasizing technology acceptance, and enriching emotional support systems to create a favorable environment for improving preschool inclusive teachers' digital literacy. The unique value of this study lies in revealing the mechanism through which traditional cultural cognition influences digital literacy, providing empirical evidence for teacher training and policy-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital literacy; Job insecurity; Preschool inclusive teachers; Technology acceptance; Traditional culture perception","adult; computer literacy; cultural anthropology; female; human; job security; male; middle aged; preschool child; psychology; questionnaire; school teacher; Adult; Child, Preschool; Computer Literacy; Culture; Female; Humans; Job Security; Male; Middle Aged; School Teachers; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Data from 775 older adults aged 60 years or older were collected between October 2021 and October 2022. To fulfill the study objective, the study used Latent Class Cluster Analysis to segment older adults into classes based on their familiarity with new transportation options and their perceptions of autonomous vehicles. The effects of transportation barriers on class membership were analyzed by employing a Structural Equation Model. The Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) identified three distinct groups of older adults based on their familiarity with new mobility services and perceptions of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The first group, Unacquainted Older Adults with Negative Perceptions, lacked familiarity with new transportation options and held negative views on AVs. They were more likely to experience individual-level barriers, including mobility impairments, driving cessation, and lack of smartphone access. The second group, Acquainted Older Adults with Negative Perceptions, was aware of ride-hailing, car-sharing, and micromobility services but remained skeptical about AVs. They primarily faced interpersonal and community-level barriers, such as lack of informal rides, limited taxi access, and social support constraints. The third group, Acquainted Older Adults with Positive Perceptions, was the most familiar with new mobility options and exhibited a favorable attitude toward AVs. However, they faced car access limitations and environmental barriers, such as limited public transit and inadequate pedestrian infrastructure. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions, technology training, infrastructure improvements, and policy initiatives to enhance familiarity with new transportation options among older adults’ mobility and acceptance of AVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Familiarity with new transportation options; Latent Class Cluster Analysis; Older adult; Perception towards Autonomous Vehicle; Rural state; Transportation barriers","Navigation; Arkansas; Autonomous car; Autonomous Vehicles; Class-based; Familiarity with new transportation option; Latent class cluster analysis; Older adults; Perception toward autonomous vehicle; Rural state; Transportation barrier; Autonomous vehicles"

These technologies are becoming more and more popular in increasing educational access in impoverished nations. The ongoing investigation looks into the variables impacting students’ use of online learning technologies in universities, particularly considering the circumstances of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. We use the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) paradigm model, which provided a strong analytical background for understanding the dynamics of technology acceptance and usage within this situation. This study examined the UTAUT model among 410 students from KP’s higher education institutions. A strong correlation was found between constructs, supporting 10 of 16 hypotheses. Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Attitude (At) explained 73% of Behavioral Intention (BI) variance. These variables also accounted for 63% of At variance. BI and At jointly explained 73% of Use Behavior (UB) variance. The significant relationships in the study include PE having a significant effect on BI (β = 0.347, p-value = ***), SI affecting BI (β = 0.130, p-value = 0.006) and At significantly influencing BI (β = 0.312, p-value = ***). Additionally, PE and EE both significantly impact At, with β values of 0.339 and 0.367, respectively (both p-values = ***). At also significantly predicts UB (β = 0.229, p-value = 0.002), while BI has a strong effect on UB (β = 0.668, p-value = ***). The analysis reveals PE has a weak effect on At (f² = 0.13) and a moderate effect on BI (f² = 0.17), while both At (f² = 0.19) and BI (f² = 0.15) have moderate effects on UB. The study’s conclusion shows that the success of online learning technologies positively impacts the students’ actual use behavior in higher education institutions. This suggests a positive correlation between the usage of online learning software tools and the achievement of education goals. By recognizing and understanding these perceptions, we recommend that facilitators and institutes make up-to-date assessments to improve student online learning involvement. The study adds valuable knowledge regarding the elements impacting students’ adoption and acceptance of online learning technologies at universities. The study emphasizes the importance of fostering a supportive environment for integrating online learning tools in educational settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Online learning technologies; SEM; Technology-enhanced learning; UTAUT model",""

Background While GenAI has attracted widespread public attention, there is insufficient research on integrating art-based AI generators in digital art and design classrooms. Concurrently, there is a demand for collecting and integrating faculty and educators’ perspectives, which are key stakeholders in preparing future art and design professionals for the GenAI-driven workforce. Our study is presented against such a backdrop. Methodology The study incorporated a mixed-method approach to analyze survey data collected from higher education faculty on their perception of text-to-image generators. Quantitative data was analyzed through statistical analysis, and qualitative data was analyzed through a blend of human-AI thematic analysis. Contribution The study provides empirical data on higher education faculty’s perspectives regarding the implications of art-based AI generators through survey and mixed-method analysis, serving as a baseline for further research and the development of AI literacy interventions. Additionally, the research identifies effective pedagogical strategies and best practices for embedding generative AI into teaching and learning, contributing to the field of education. Findings Art-based GenAIs create both positive disruptions (e.g., improved ideation, problem-solving, and creative processes) and negative disruptions (e.g., ethical implications, technical limitations, and pedagogical concerns) in higher education. Insufficient AI literacy and inadequate resources among faculty significantly set back the effective adoption of GenAIs in classrooms. Ethical issues, including academic integrity, copyright, and bias, emerge as prominent issues requiring the implementation of responsible AI frameworks and policies. Adopting pedagogical strategies, such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning, can help optimize student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Last but not least, a healthy digital art ecosystem in higher education hinges on responsible AI use and standards, continuous technological improvement, effective educational support, a human-centered approach, and a strong sense of community and collaboration. Recommendations The paper recommends increasing AI literacy among faculty through profesfor Practitioners sional development programs and collaborative learning initiatives; developing and implementing responsible AI use policies, guidelines, and frameworks to address ethical concerns and ensure the effective and ethical use of GenAIs in classrooms; and integrating pedagogical strategies such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes with GenAIs. Recommendations The paper recommends conducting further research on the integration of art-for Researchers based generative AI in digital art and design classrooms across all academic levels; further exploring faculty and educators’ perspectives on GenAI use to develop best practices and frameworks for effective and ethical adoption in higher education; and investigating the long-term impacts of GenAI technologies on teaching and learning in art, design, and creative-integrated disciplines through longitudinal studies. Impact on Society The larger implications of the paper’s findings include promoting awareness and education on the ethical implications, benefits, and limitations of GenAIs to foster responsible use and acceptance; encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration to address the challenges and opportunities presented by GenAIs in the creative and cultural industries; and supporting the development of a healthy digital art ecosystem that balances human creativity with technological advancements, ensuring inclusivity, accessibility, and sustainability. Future Research Based on drawbacks that emerged from the study, such as the sampling method and the sample size, future research should focus on targeting larger and more diverse samples from across different regions of the United States, as well as integrating objective measures to complement self-reported data. As this research is focused on text-to-image generators, future research should expand to additional GenAI types and models to deepen our understanding of their potential benefits and use impacts. Additionally, future research would benefit from studying the long-term impacts of GenAIs on education and the development of human-centered solutions and interventions tailored for faculty and students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","art & culture; empirical research; generative AI; higher education; information technology; responsible AI",""

However, consumer perceptions of recent advances, particularly new breeding techniques (NBTs), remain underexplored. This study examines South African consumer attitudes towards plant breeding innovations, using a mixed-methods approach. The initial focus group interviews informed the development of a structured quantitative survey examining familiarity, perceptions, and acceptance of plant breeding technologies. Consumer awareness of plant breeding principles was found to be limited, with 67–68% of respondents unfamiliar with both conventional and modern plant breeding procedures. Despite this information gap, consumers expressed conditional support for modern breeding techniques, especially when associated with actual benefits like increased nutritional value, environmental sustainability, and crop resilience. When favourable effects were outlined, support for general investment in modern breeding practices climbed from 45% to 74%. Consumer purchase decisions emphasised price, product quality, and convenience over manufacturing techniques, with sustainability ranked last among the assessed factors. Trust in the sources of food safety information varied greatly, with medical experts and scientists being ranked highly, while government sources were viewed more sceptically. The results further suggest that targeted education could improve customer confidence, as there is a significant positive association (R2 = 0.938) between familiarity and acceptance. These findings emphasise the significance of open communication strategies and focused consumer education in increasing the adoption of plant breeding breakthroughs. The study offers useful insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders working on engagement strategies to facilitate the ethical growth and application of agricultural biotechnology in support of food security and quality in South Africa. This study contributes to a better understanding of South African consumers’ perceptions of plant breeding innovations and food safety. The research findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders in developing effective engagement and communication strategies that address consumer concerns and promote the adoption of products derived from diverse plant breeding technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","consumer perception; food security; new breeding techniques (NBTs); plant breeding; South Africa","biotechnology; communication and information media; economic growth; food safety; government; plant breeding; sustainability; South Africa"

Recognizing the potential of AI-driven tools to address academic support gaps, particularly in developing regions, the research explores how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions influence students' behavioral intentions and subsequent adoption of chatbots for academic use. The study employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data from a diverse sample of university students, enabling a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships among these factors. The findings reveal that performance expectancy—the belief that chatbots will enhance academic performance and facilitating conditions, such as internet access and institutional support, play significant roles in motivating students to adopt chatbots. However, effort expectancy, or the perceived ease of use, does not directly drive adoption intentions. This suggests that students prioritize practical benefits over user-friendliness, an insight valuable for universities aiming to implement effective chatbot systems. Moreover, the results align with the Socio-Technical Interaction Network (STIN) model, which emphasizes the need for a cohesive social and technical framework to foster technological acceptance. The STIN model’s perspective underscores that students' engagement with chatbots is not just a matter of usability but also of how well the technology is supported by the broader educational infrastructure. This study offers actionable insights for Indonesian universities and other institutions in similar contexts, proposing that enhancing campus resources, like reliable internet access and technical support, can drive chatbot adoption. By focusing on performance-based benefits and strengthening the socio-technical environment, universities can effectively integrate AI-based learning tools, addressing both technical and socio-cultural barriers. Such initiatives support students’ learning experiences and foster an adaptive academic ecosystem where AI tools serve as essential assets in overcoming resource limitations.

Therefore, this study aims to test a “perception-attitude-intention” linking framework built upon the “Unified Theory of Technology Acceptance and Use” (UTAUT) and analyze the behavioral intentions of existing automobile users to embrace battery electric cars. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model tests the underlying direct paths, the mediation of attitudes and the moderating gender effects in predicting users’ attitudes and behavioral intentions to adopt battery electric cars using a techno-psychological approach from UTAUT. “Structural equation modeling” is used to analyze the model using the 361 valid online responses received from conventional car owners. Findings: The results show that behavioral intentions are directly predicted by UTAUT measures with attitudes and indirectly through its mediation and gender moderation. The results support the “Perceptions-Attitudes-Intentions” linkage model that explains the phenomenon of electric car adoption. However, the mediating and moderating paths between facilitating conditions and intentions do not support the model. In addition, the research corroborates that men have a stronger effect than women on behavioral intentions to prefer battery electric cars. Research limitations/implications: This work may assist manufacturers and regulators in developing marketing policies to encourage consumers’ adoption of battery electric cars and potentially improve their favorable perception of these vehicles. Originality/value: This study contributes to the comprehension of how UTAUT constructs shape consumers’ attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding the adoption of battery cars equipped with emission-free technology. This study validates the grounded framework “perception-attitude-intention” linkage model, which also describes gender-wise differences toward electric car adoption in the backdrop of Indian sustainable transportation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes; Battery electric car; Behavioral intentions; Gender effects; Social influence; Sustainable transportation; Unified theory of technology acceptance and use","Acceptance tests; Automotive batteries; Concrete construction; Ground vehicles; Attitude; Battery electric car; Behavioral intention; Electric cars; Gender effects; Social influence; Sustainable transportation; Technology acceptance; Technology use; Unified theory; Unified theory of technology acceptance and use; Automotive industry"

Through mixed methods, this study identifies familiarity, cost-saving concerns, social influence, and perceived usefulness as significant factors influencing Norwegian consumers’ behavioral intentions to utilize SMT. Despite mandatory smart meter installations, many Norwegian consumers demonstrate limited familiarity and low utilization of advanced features, such as accessing detailed consumption data through additional connected equipment. What is the implication of the main findings? The findings highlight the need for targeted informational campaigns and financial incentives to enhance user familiarity, reduce barriers to accessing smart meter functionalities, and promote active consumer engagement. Policymakers and energy providers should consider strategies emphasizing practical guidance and clear communication about SMT benefits to increase technology utilization and realize sustainability goals. The rapid adoption of smart technologies is increasingly evident in both personal and business contexts. The ‘post-pandemic’ economic recovery of 2022 and 2023 coincided with a global energy supply shortage driven by heightened energy demand and supply chain disruptions stemming from the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The implementation of smart metering systems is a central component of European policies aimed at enhancing the competitiveness and environmental sustainability of energy markets. However, limited research exists on the acceptance of Smart Meter Technology (SMT) in general, specifically in Norway, as compared to other nations. SMT devices offer the potential for real-time energy consumption monitoring, enabling users to track and modify their usage patterns for optimized consumption. This study employs a mixed-methods research design to gather insights from both SMT consumers and vendors. Findings underscore the pivotal roles of familiarity, cost, social influence, and perceived usefulness in shaping consumer adoption of SMT.

As digital learning contexts become progressively more prevalent in higher education institutions, it is critical to understand how these technologies foster the academic success of university students with blindness or low vision. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the study conducted a quantitative research approach and collected data from 390 visually impaired students who were enrolled in different universities across Saudi Arabia (SA). Employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the paper tested the influences of four UTAUT dimensions—Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC)—on Academic Performance (AP), while also evaluating the mediating role of Behavioral Intention (BI). The results revealed a significant positive relationship between the implementation of AI-based assistive tools and students’ academic success. Particularly, BI emerged as a key mediator in these intersections. The results indicated that PE (β = 0.137, R2 = 0.745), SI (β = 0.070, R2 = 0.745), and BI (β = 0.792, R2 = 0.745) significantly affected AP. In contrast, EE (β = −0.041, R2 = 0.745) and FC (β = −0.004, R2 = 0.745) did not have a significant effect on AP. Concerning predictors of BI, PE (β = 0.412, R2 = 0.317), SI (β = 0.462, R2 = 0.317), and EE (β = 0.139, R2 = 0.317) were all positively associated with BI. However, FC had a significant negative association with BI (β = −0.194, R2 = 0.317). Additionally, the analysis revealed that EE, SI, and PE can all indirectly enhance Academic Performance by influencing BI.

This research integrates concepts from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Protection Motivation Theory to examine key factors including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, response cost, response efficacy, and self-efficacy. The study uses Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling and Necessary Condition Analysis to reveal distinct behavior in influencing pro-environmental and green behaviors. Pro-environmental behavior is primarily driven by broader motivational factors such as social influence and perceived severity, whereas green behavior is more strongly associated with practical considerations like effort expectancy and performance expectancy. Additionally, Necessary Condition Analysis identifies critical threshold conditions necessary to achieve specific levels of these behaviors by offering actionable insights for organizational interventions. The research findings underscore the theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this research advances understanding by distinguishing the drivers of pro-environmental and green behaviors while demonstrating the methodological utility of Necessary Condition Analysis.

Therefore, this study aims to examine a set of determinants potentially influencing the behavioral intention to adopt electric scooter (e-scooter) sharing systems among current non-users emphasizing on gender differences. For this purpose, we conducted an e-survey, with 449 complete responses from Babol's residents in Iran. Once the data was gathered, an integrated theoretical framework was developed by synthesizing constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The data were analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results show that perceived behavioral control, subjective norms (pertaining to peers and media influences), perceived value, and environmental concerns have a positive influence on the self-reported intention to engaging in e-scooter usage. Conversely, perceived risk had a significant and negative influence on intention, that was consistent across genders. Notably, the sharing tendency did not emerge as a significant predictor of the intention to use e-scooters. These insights inform strategies to promote this eco-friendly transportation mode, enhancing social inclusion by tailoring interventions to diverse gender-specific needs, a pivotal contribution of this work. Moreover, it provides critical insights into determinants of e-scooter sharing adoption, advancing social inclusion by informing gender-tailored strategies to promote this sustainable mode, a key contribution that supports effective, inclusive interventions for diverse user segments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral intention; Electric scooter sharing; Gender differences; Social inclusion; Theory of planned behavior; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; User acceptance",""

This research aims to identify key areas where the intention to acquire photovoltaic systems might be improved. The purchasing intention of Photovoltaic systems is influenced by various individual theories, including the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Model of Technology Acceptance (TAM), and the Theory of the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI). The data we collected came from an online survey that was distributed in May 2024 to a cohort of 1200 persons who are members of a paid panel managed by Credamo.com. The eligible participants were limited to individuals who owned homes in China and did not have solar panels. We use Amos and SPSS for data analysis. We choose China since it is one of the major RPV marketplaces globally, offering numerous purchasing opportunities. Since most of the study on China's adoption of PV systems has been theoretical and not cumulative, an additional purpose is to establish a foundation for future research endeavors. The present study introduces a comprehensive framework that aims to explain consumer interest in residential photovoltaics by incorporating aspects from Technology Acceptance Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Diffusion of Innovation. The study results demonstrate a robust and favorable impact of the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Technological Acceptance Model, and the Diffusion of Innovations on the intention to purchase photovoltaic systems. As anticipated by the DOI (Diffusion of Innovation) theory, the findings indicate that the innovativeness of DOI is positively associated with the inclination to engage in discussions about a potential purchase of a photovoltaic (PV) system. The results indicate that both the total effect and direct effect are statistically significant (S.E: 0.276, P: 0.000) accounting for 34 % of the overall contribution. Consumer novelty seeking had a significant beneficial impact on interest and also had favorable indirect impacts through perceived relative advantage. The TPB variables explained 31 % of the variance in interest, taking into account household limitations. The inclusion of social curiosity in the model revealed that the belief in the personal benefits of solar panels had the most powerful direct and overall impact on interest. This was demonstrated by the significant (S.E: 0.313, P: 0.000) direct and total effect on the intention to purchase a PV system for household use. The analytical findings demonstrate a direct and favorable relationship between the Technology Acceptance Model, also known as the TAM, and the intention to acquire photovoltaic (PV) systems in China. The findings demonstrate a 35 % variation and emphasize the significance (S.E: 0.070, P: 0.000) of improving the perceived simplicity of use and perceived usefulness of PV systems in order to encourage customer adoption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental turbulence; Technology acceptance model; Theory of planned behavior; Theory of the diffusion of innovations; Trust in technology","adult; behavior; China; consumer attitude; diffusion of innovation; female; human; male; middle aged; psychological theory; questionnaire; solar energy; young adult; Adult; Consumer Behavior; Diffusion of Innovation; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Psychological Theory; Solar Energy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"

However, there is limited information on how users across the world will perceive these upcoming solutions. The study aims to pinpoint the key features influencing current users and future users of autonomous delivery robots. It employs two statistical models based on a field study of 1344 e-commerce customers across Europe, Asia, and the USA to explain these characteristics. An ordered logit model combines data from all three continents to give insights into the factors influencing global current demand for autonomous delivery robots. Additionally, three independent structural equation models, each focusing on a specific region were employed to analyze future demand, facilitating a comparison of key variables influencing potential usage across regions. Individuals already familiar with ADR technology tend to show greater acceptance, influenced by factors such as its design, perceived environmental benefits in urban settings, and overall trust and good perception toward the technology. Across the three surveyed regions, ease of use consistently emerges as a shared priority. However, in Europe and the USA, cost considerations and the perceived risks associated with technology competence play a more significant role, while social influences strongly impact adoption in Europe and Asia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","City logistics; Ordered logit model; Structural equation modeling; Survey; User-acceptability",""

The prospective of AR to seamlessly integrate digital information into the actual environment has proven to be a challenge for academics and industry, as they endeavor to understand and predict the influence on users' perceptions, adoption intentions and usage. This study investigates the factors affecting consumers’ behavioral intention to adopt AR technology in shopping malls by offering the mobile technology acceptance model (MTAM). Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual framework is based on mobile self-efficacy, rewards, social influence and enjoyment of existing MTAM constructs. A self-administered questionnaire, constructed by measuring questions modified from previous research, elicited 311 usable responses from mobile respondents who had recently used AR technology in shopping malls. This analysis was performed using SmartPLS3.0. Findings: Grounded on the findings of the study, it was found that, aside from factors such as mobile usefulness, ease of use and social influence, the remaining independent variables had the most significant impact on adopting AR technologies. Considering the limitations of this study, the paper concludes by discussing the significant implications and insinuating avenues for future research. Originality/value: To better investigate mobile AR app adoption in Pakistan’s shopping malls, the researchers modified the newly proposed MTAM model by incorporating mobile self-efficacy theory, social influence, rewards and perceived enjoyment. However, the extended model has not been extensively studied in previous research. This study is the first to examine the variables that affect an individual’s intention to accept mobile AR apps by using a novel extended MTAM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Augmented reality; Mobile commerce; MTAM; Pakistan; Shopping malls",""

We use a comprehensive survey and path analysis to investigate the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, income and education) and ELV acceptance, revealing complex preferences and concerns across several population groups. Comparative analyses with previous research reveal gender-specific inequities and age-related problems, emphasizing the importance of customized measures. Our findings indicate that environmental concerns exhibit a significant positive relationship with community acceptance (path coefficient = 0.426, p < 0.001). Moreover, technological familiarity (path coefficient = 0.352, p < 0.001) and infrastructure availability (path coefficient = 0.518, p < 0.001) demonstrate noteworthy positive associations, emphasizing the role of knowledge and accessible infrastructure in promoting acceptance. Conversely, the cost of adoption exhibits a negative relationship with societal acceptance (path coefficient = −0.269, p < 0.001), suggesting potential challenges that must be addressed. Mediation analysis uncovers the mediating roles of information exposure, perceived safety, as well as convenience and accessibility. Total effects analysis validates the collective influence of crucial factors while acknowledging the potential hindrance posed by the cost of adoption. Our findings contribute to inclusive policies and initiatives for sustainable ELV practices, offering insights to address a critical environmental issue in Indonesia.

Emoticons are frequently employed in written communication, such as text messaging, social media platforms and various digital mediums, with the purpose of expressing emotions or providing more meaning to a statement. Adopting emojis in the professional environment has become a modern method to convey emotions, offer feedback, and express appreciation amongst peers. This exploration underlines the intersection of technology – specifically the use of emojis – and its influence on interpersonal interactions and dynamics within the professional setting. This draws attention to the need for effective communication, setting clear expectations, and understanding the implications of technology on workers' attitudes and behaviours. For deeper analysis, this study employs two pivotal frameworks: the theory of operant conditioning and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The former probes into the effects of outcomes, such as the usage of emojis, on employees' behaviours in the office context. The latter, on the other hand, explores the acceptance and perceptions employees have towards such technological innovations. Emphasizing effective communication becomes paramount when we consider the role technology plays in shaping our interactions and viewpoints. While emojis can potentially enhance the clarity and effectiveness of communication, they come with their set of challenges. It's vital to approach their use with discretion, particularly in sensitive scenarios like performance evaluations. In such contexts, the margin for misunderstanding is high, and incorrect interpretations can lead to unintended consequences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption; Emojis; organizational communication; technology; workplace",""

Despite its relevance to sustainable digital transformation, the adoption of blockchain in accounting practices remains limited, particularly in developing economies such as Vietnam. This study investigates the behavioral factors influencing the intention to adopt blockchain in financial accounting among manufacturing enterprises, drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Survey data from 320 Vietnamese manufacturing firms were analyzed using Cronbach’s Alpha, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine both direct effects and mediating pathways. The results reveal that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived cost significantly affect attitudes, which in turn strongly predict intentions to adopt blockchain. Attitudes also partially mediate these relationships, underscoring their central role in shaping sustainable technology adoption behavior.

Although AI chatbots have brought many opportunities to education and teacher trainees, they have also caused many problems and resistance among some teacher trainees. However, previous studies have focused more on the influence of positive acceptance factors induced by AI chatbots and less on the negative barrier model induced by AI chatbots. Therefore, this study starts from the negative barrier factors induced by AI chatbots and builds an influencing barrier model of AI chatbot resistance guided by Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and appropriately draws on Cultural Dimension Theory (CDT), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and practical characteristics. The questionnaires mainly adopt convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the data are empirically analyzed. The results show that Uncertainty Avoidance, the Social Influence Barrier, and Technology Anxiety have a significant and direct influence on teacher trainees’ resistance to AI chatbots. Meanwhile, Uncertainty Avoidance, the Social Influence Barrier, and Technology Anxiety play significant mediating roles in the impact of the Usage Barrier (UB), Image Barrier (IB), Value Barrier (VB), Risk Barrier (RB), and Tradition Barrier (TB) on resistance behaviors, revealing the complex path through which cognition-emotion-society factors jointly shape technology resistance behaviors. Therefore, this study not only contributes to enriching the theoretical results of combining Innovation Resistance Theory with AI chatbots and adding new research paths (e.g., the mediating role of Uncertainty Avoidance) but also provides a practical guide for the dissemination of AI chatbots among teacher trainees and future technological talents in a sustainable future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI chatbots; artificial intelligence; barrier; education; innovation resistance theory; sustainable","artificial intelligence; education; innovation; numerical model; sustainability; theoretical study"

However, the cybersecurity risk impedes its widespread adoption among the users. So, this paper aimed to investigate the drivers that influence the decentralized fintech platforms adoption intention in the cyber risk environment. The study integrated two dominant theories including Technology acceptance model and Trust theory to develop the research framework. A survey questionnaire was developed and distributed among Generation Z who are studying in different universities in Klang Valley Malaysia. A total of 391 valid responses were received. The data were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and necessary condition analysis (NCA). Findings indicate that digital literacy (DL), perceived security (PS), social influence (SI), risk tolerance (RT), and trust in technology (T) significantly affects Generation Z users’ intention to adopt decentralized fintech platforms. Additionally, trust in technology partially mediates the relationship between risk tolerance and DFP adoption intention. However, NCA analysis showed that perceived security, social influence, risk tolerance, and trust in technology are the necessary conditions for users' DFP adoption intention. This study contributes to both theory and practice by offering a comprehensive model for understanding cybersecurity perceptions in decentralized fintech adoption in cyber risk environment. It provides valuable insights for academics exploring DFP user behavior in emerging markets and highlights the role of trust in technology in shaping adoption intention decisions. The findings also underscore both opportunities and challenges for its adoption. Key opportunities lie in leveraging peer-driven influence and platform trust to engage Gen Z, while challenges include addressing persistent cybersecurity concerns through transparent design, targeted education, and inclusive regulation. Ensuring widespread adoption will require coordinated efforts between developers, policymakers, and educators to foster both confidence and digital resilience in this emerging financial paradigm. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital literacy; Perceived security; Risk tolerance; Social influence; Trust in technology",""

If such services effectively enable travellers to share a vehicle instead of driving alone, higher vehicle occupancy rates would lead to a more efficient use of existing road infrastructure. This in turn could help alleviate traffic congestion and its associated drawbacks. The acceptance of such autonomous ridepooling (aRP) services by prospective users is essential for their successful adoption. Therefore, this qualitative study aims to uncover the relevant factors that determine aRP acceptance and to better understand the drivers and barriers of aRP acceptance using a user-centered approach. Through 18 semi-structured in-depth interviews with a diverse range of participants, the study revealed the significance of performance expectations with regards to safety, comfort, flexibility, sustainability, and social aspects in shaping acceptance for aRP. Notably, ambivalent attitudes and controversial perceptions of these factors as well as differences between public transport and private car users underscore the importance of customer segmentation and tailored strategies for the design and promotion of aRP services. Findings emphasize the need for aRP services to prioritize user-centric approaches to enable the adoption and facilitate the integration of aRP as a more sustainable option into future transportation systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous vehicles; Ridepooling; Technology acceptance model; User-centered service design",""

Among these platforms, social media became a powerful tool for learning and knowledge dissemination. Despite its great potential, the factors influencing learners' behavioral intention to share knowledge on social media remained inadequately explored. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the determinants of learners' behavioral intention to share knowledge in social media environments through the lens of push–pull theory and employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Using the Questionnaire Star platform, this study collected 203 responses from 22 universities in Zhejiang Province through convenience and snowball sampling and analyzed the data using fsQCA 3.0 software. The results revealed that learners' propensity to share knowledge was shaped by various factors, including personal habits, technology acceptance models, and the technical attributes and flexibility of social media platforms. By integrating novel theoretical frameworks and methodologies, the study identified multiple configurations conducive to high levels of knowledge-sharing intention among learners, uncovering three distinct patterns and five configurations. Notably, lower levels of habit and stronger task-technology fit emerged as key drivers. Moreover, the study emphasized the importance of considering multiple factors when optimizing social media platforms to meet learners' needs and foster knowledge exchange. While the study had certain geographical and cultural limitations, its findings offered valuable theoretical and practical implications for future research in the fields of social media and educational technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral intention; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; Knowledge sharing; Push–pull theory; Social media",""

This study performed a systematic review of 32 peer-reviewed articles from 2004 to 2024 to identify the main drivers of electric vehicle adoption in urban areas. The study's findings are categorized into five primary themes through inductive and deductive coding: economic, social, infrastructural, technological, and policy-related factors. Government interventions through financial incentives and stricter emissions regulations demonstrate their importance as policy-related factors which account for 25 % of reviewed literature. Economic aspects (22 %) influence consumer choices by addressing affordability and operational expenses along with financial advantages. The infrastructure sector (21 %) together with technology (20%) serve as primary forces pushing for extensive charging networks, expanded power grids and better battery and charging systems. The impact of consumer behaviour along with environmental awareness and societal perceptions accounts for 12 % of social factors influencing EV acceptance. The research exposes major differences between developed and emerging markets which indicates a necessity for customised EV adoption approaches. Developed areas focus on advancing technology and policy development whereas emerging markets encounter difficulties related to financial access and infrastructure constraints. Future studies need to investigate how EVs can be adopted by people living in rural locations as well as those from underrepresented demographic sectors. This research delivers essential guidance for decision-makers in government and industry along with urban developers to establish a system that boosts EV adoption towards sustainable city transportation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric vehicles (EVs); EV adoption; NVivo; Policy interventions; Sustainable mobility; Systematic review; Urban transportation",""

This novel service could reduce congestion and improve both mobility and sustainability. To facilitate the implementation of SASs, more research is needed on the psychological aspects of sharing a small, intimate shuttle with strangers. The current study is among the first to use open-ended questions to investigate SAS acceptance. This investigation is based on the Multi-Level Model on Automated Vehicle Acceptance (MAVA). We had 236 participants answer short-form interviews including both open-ended questions and quantitative items. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlations, and qualitative data analyzed with directed content analysis. Respondents seem very positive about the proposed new transport service. We found that perceived usefulness, hedonic motivation, trust, and social influence shared large correlations with intentions to use. Other factors such as demographics, technology savviness and use of public transport did not share a linear relationship with intentions to use. Qualitative analysis suggests that, while most people do not mind sharing shuttles with strangers, some could find the social situation deterring. People seem most concerned with availability, effectiveness, travel cost and safety. The reported positive attitudes towards the service seem predicated upon trust in the government regulation and proper testing of the technology, that many think of as immature. Regulation and thorough testing may be paramount in keeping people positive.

Previous studies have focused on the perceptions of consumers and farmers, overlooking the broader diversity of perspectives within the sector. This study seeks to address this gap by exploring the range of social perspectives on the use of reclaimed water for irrigation in Spain. Using Q methodology, we identified existing perspectives as well as synergies and frictions among them. We interviewed 23 stakeholders from environmental NGOs, food retailers, consumer and farmer organisations, public administrations, water treatment companies and associations, and water reuse experts. The results reveal three distinct perspectives: 1) reclaimed water must be promoted to secure agricultural production; 2) it has great potential, but needs technological improvement; and 3) it poses environmental risks, warranting cautious expansion. All perspectives agree that reclaimed water is a valuable resource for irrigation, but consumers lack sufficient information about its quality and benefits. Disagreements exist regarding its potential ecological impacts and who should bear the costs of reuse projects. Results suggest that avoiding negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts requires case by case consideration of reclamation technology and site-specific conditions. Additionally, awareness campaigns and stronger administrative support are crucial for promoting agricultural reclamation initiatives. This study underscores the importance of fostering stakeholder dialogue to promote sustainable and equitable reclaimed water use, ultimately supporting fair and effective water policies in Spain and other regions facing similar challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural irrigation; Perceptions; Q methodology; Spain; Wastewater; Water reuse","Agricultural irrigation; Agricultural productions; Farmer organization; Food retailers; Q methodology; Re-claimed water; Social acceptance; Social perspective; Spain; Water reuse; agricultural management; irrigation system; perception; stakeholder; sustainability; wastewater treatment; water use; agricultural worker; Article; consumer; environmental risk; human; irrigation (agriculture); waste water recycling; water supply; water treatment; agriculture; environmental protection; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farmers; Humans"

Meanwhile, knowledge management has proven to be a critical part of contemporary business practices. Thus, there is a growing demand for socially and environmentally aware behaviour as a part of existing strategies for dealing with the effects of such practices in the realm of sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. This study adopts a dimensional view of the knowledge-management model and its effect on sustainable entrepreneurship in Malaysia. We also include green information technology (GIT) acceptance in the model to examine its moderating effect on the proposed model. Partial least-squares structural equation modelling is used to explore the connections among variables. The results reveal that knowledge creation and transfer have a significant and positive relationship with sustainable entrepreneurship. However, the application and use of knowledge have insignificant effects on sustainable entrepreneurship. We also find that GIT acceptance significantly moderates the relationship between knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and storage, and sustainable entrepreneurship. By contrast, it insignificantly moderates the association between the application and use of knowledge and sustainable entrepreneurship.

Readiness, driven by motivation, technical skills, and self-management, affects online learning participation. This readiness is made up of self-learning and communication abilities in online environments, which influence acceptance and satisfaction. Peer support inspires collaboration and enhances learning gains. It reduces loneliness, boosts motivation, and facilitates teamwork, while instructional support aids learning through organized interaction and feedback. Instructional support (e.g., immediate feedback and well-structured instruction) also improves engagement and perceived accomplishment in online education. The study employed a systematic sampling plan, using 308 students at an American university pursuing online or blended courses. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the measurement model, confirming construct validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling confirmed the tested hypotheses and relationships among the variables. Students who perceive online learning as useful and convenient are more inclined to engage with the learning management system, which aligns with the technology acceptance model. Psychological, technological, and behavioral readiness play a primary role in determining whether self-efficacious and self-regulated learners will adapt. Peer support is important in offsetting the alienating effect of e-learning and facilitating engagement, motivation, and cognitive presence. Interpersonal behavior, such as peer mentoring and group discussion, increases social belonging, reduces anxiety, and develops academic resilience. Instructional support is critical to the acceptance of online learning. Timely scaffolding and immediate feedback increase students' engagement and motivation. Institutional investments in technical and non-technical resources enable active participation. The study's broader implications are multifaceted and require a holistic approach focusing on content delivery, actively preparing students, fostering social connections, and supporting them throughout their journey. Student readiness is not a static trait; rather, it can be intentionally developed over time. Administrators should take pre-emptive measures with course design and focused interventions, like student training that promotes independence and empowerment. Institutional-level policies promoting peer-to-peer cooperation will enable universities to raise the general acceptability of online learning, student involvement, and satisfaction. Instructional support must prioritize clarity and engagement to foster student acceptance of online learning. Institutions can significantly enhance the acceptance of online learning by employing academic and emotional support, integrating technology, and providing comprehensive learning support services. In addition, institutions must constantly build and maintain a solid technology and non-technology support system that includes e-advising, e-tutoring, and mental health counseling for online students. The study advances e-learning practices by reframing student readiness as a dynamic quality that organizations can cultivate with focused instruction and assistance. The results offer practical advice for creating welcoming, stimulating, and encouraging online environments that increase student acceptance of online learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Higher education; Instructional support; Online learning; Online learning acceptance; Peer support; Readiness for online learning",""

To investigate the usage intention of this service among visitors, the author of this research employs an integrated approach consisting of two psychological frameworks: the Norm Activation Model (NAM) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Design/methodology/approach: The integrated NAM-TAM model is implemented to conduct a survey (sample n = 777) with visitors to Hanoi, Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City regarding the factors underlying their intentions to continue using the PBRS TNGo. Findings: Structural equation models suggested that: (1) the NAM-TAM can explain behavioural intention to use a smart PBRS. Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PE), and Awareness of Consequences (AC) have positive and significant impacts on Attitude Towards Using (AT) and, thus, on Behavioural Intention to Use (BI). Also, Personal Norms (PN) positively influence BI. (2) Among the four independent variables, tourists' AC produces the most potent effect on the intention to continue using a PBRS. Research limitations/implications: This study can start a new research direction of combining the NAM with other theoretical frameworks to explain customer behaviour in the field of sustainable tourism practices. Future research should explore the proposed model based on comparisons of different tourists’ backgrounds, including nationality, length of stay, spending level, visiting purpose, etc. Practical implications: This research provides strategic implications for destination management organisations in boosting the use of PBRS amongst tourists, contributing to the environmental sustainability targets of the tourism industry. Originality/value: This study responds to the existing gap by examining both functional value (indicated by PU and PE) and perceived environmental/social value (proxied by AC) in forming tourists’ attitudes towards PBRS and their usage intention. Our study, therefore, actively contributes to the research stream of tourist behaviour in the field of sustainable tourism practices from the altruistic behavioural perspective. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Green travel; Norm activation model; Public bike rental service (PBRS); Smart tourism; Technology acceptance model",""

While it has the potential to promote sustainable agriculture and food security, the broad implementation of climate-smart agriculture highly depends on farmers' attitudes and preferences. This study aims to identify and analyze the driving mechanisms behind farmers' acceptance of climate-smart agriculture. To achieve this, we establish a research model to explore farmers' acceptance of climate-smart agriculture. A cross-sectional questionnaire investigation is conducted to obtain research data in rural China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is employed to test the theoretical research model's validity. The results reveal that 89.2 % of the variance in farmers' willingness to adopt climate-smart agriculture is interpreted by the proposed research model. The findings highlight that egoistic factors significantly impact farmers' willingness to use climate-smart agriculture more than altruistic ones. The path analysis indicates that awareness of consequences and perceived value exhibit the strongest direct impacts on farmers' behavioral intentions.

Based on stress and coping theory, this study develops a framework to examine the patterns and determinants of cancer patients’ help-seeking behaviors in OHCs. We collected 19,224 help-seeking posts from a leading cancer-focused OHC in China between January 2016 and July 2023. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining content analysis through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for behavioral pattern identification and beta regression for determinant analysis. The results revealed two primary categories of help-seeking behaviors - emotional and informational - which comprised six distinct topics: daily emotional regulation, community social support, medical options, treatment processes, medical results interpretation, and medication management and effects. Female patients exhibited stronger tendencies toward emotional help-seeking, while male patients favored informational help-seeking. Both increasing age and time since diagnosis were positively associated with emotional help-seeking but negatively correlated with informational help-seeking. Moreover, different cancer types showed distinct patterns in their help-seeking behaviors.

The livability of a city also has social and psychological dimensions, such as emotion and perception. This paper explores how the advantages of new transportation technology can be realized under mixed-traffic conditions, while meeting the requirements for safety, convenience, and high educational standards. One of the key challenges to realizing the advantages of a new technology, such as autonomous shuttle buses, under mixed-traffic conditions and under adverse weather conditions is how to strike a balance between innovation and adherence to essential urban demands. Ensuring that the introduction of advanced technologies like autonomous shuttle buses does not compromise safety is of the utmost importance. Under mixed-traffic conditions, autonomous shuttle buses must negotiate interactions with human-driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Predictable and safe driving behavior is vital to gaining the confidence and acceptance of all road users. Additionally, adopting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables real-time information exchange with other vehicles and infrastructure, which enhance safety. Autonomous shuttle buses also face crucial challenges in adverse weather conditions. Robust sensor systems are required to accurately perceive the environment despite rain, snow, fog, and other weather-related constraints. Continual learning and software updates ensure the system's ability to adapt to changing weather conditions. To overcome these challenges, collaboration with regulatory bodies and traffic management authorities is essential. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives can inform the public about the safety measures and benefits of autonomous shuttle buses, fostering acceptance and reducing concerns during the transition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous shuttle bus; livable cities; public transportation of people and goods; road congestion",""

Despite the growing popularity and advancements in immersive technologies, achieving widespread user acceptance remains a significant challenge. In addition, previous acceptance models may not fully capture the unique and emerging aspects of immersive experiences. Accordingly, understanding the underlying factors shaping user intentions towards immersive technologies is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote acceptance and foster adoption across diverse user populations and application domains. This research attempt to investigate what factors impact user’s intention to use immersive technology. We adopted the well-recognized TAM model as the theoretical ground of this study. To meet the requirements of immersive technologies, a new research model, called i-TAM (Immersive Technology Acceptance Model) is developed to examine the individuals’ acceptance of immersive technologies. The research model was tested by the data collected from 454 individuals who have interacted with an immersive platform. i-TAM suggests that perceived social presence, perceived emotional impact, perceived ease of use, and perceived learning impact behavioral intention to engage, which accordingly impacts immersive engagement. The study also examines the moderation impacts of experience on the relationships between each of perceived social presence, perceived emotional impact, perceived ease of use, and perceived learning and behavioral intention to engage. The collected data was then analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), in which both the quality of the data and the significance of paths were examined. The results support the main hypotheses of the research model and the moderation effects of experience on the relationships between perceived ease of use and perceived learning and behavioral intention to engage. i-TAM provides a useful tool and base model for researchers in conducting research in immersive technologies and helps managers and information technology developers to better understand the drivers of acceptance of an immersive technology by individuals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Immersive Technology Acceptance Model; Industrial and innovation; Metaverse; Quality Education; Theory",""

Utilizing these by-products as fertilizers allows for reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers, valorization of waste, and preservation of natural resources. However, this practice faces challenges associated with negative social perceptions, potential risks to human and environmental health, religious beliefs, and cultural factors. Our research aims, firstly, to quantify the water and fertilizer gains from the by-products of the Medea Wastewater Treatment Plant (Algeria), and secondly, to assess the social acceptability of this practice through a field survey. The results revealed a water gain sufficient to provide drinking water for a population of 91,130 inhabitants and irrigate 665 ha of arboriculture. The quantities of fertilizers contained in these by-products can fulfill the needs of the arboriculture. Regarding the social survey, inconsistencies observed in the responses of our study sample are attributed to a lack of understanding of wastewater treatment technology. Nonetheless, the majority of respondents support preserving water for future generations and are willing to participate in awareness campaigns aimed at clarifying the ambiguity surrounding this technology. These campaigns aim to maximize the benefits of agricultural reuse while mitigating risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Fertilizers; Sewage sludge; Social acceptance; Social survey; Treated water","agriculture; byproduct; fertilizer; field survey; perception; sewage; sludge; wastewater treatment; Algeria"

Drawing on survey data from 1000 commuters in Seoul, South Korea, this study examines the influence of performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions on the behavioral intention to adopt AVs. Structural equation modeling reveals that hedonic motivation (β = 0.56, p < 0.001), price value (β = 0.47, p < 0.001), and performance expectancy (β = 0.64, p < 0.001) are critical determinants of AV acceptance. Additionally, risk perception negatively impacts behavioral intention (β = −0.25, p < 0.001), while policy support (β = 0.51, p < 0.001) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.46, p < 0.001) demonstrate substantial positive influences. Demographic analysis highlights age and gender as significant moderators, with younger users prioritizing performance expectancy and being more sensitive to risk, while older users exhibit a shift from hedonic to utility-driven motivations as they age. Women exhibit greater sensitivity to policy support and economic factors, while men respond more strongly to environmental considerations. In addition, prior experience with advanced driver assistance systems amplifies the influence of enjoyment on facilitating conditions, whereas inexperienced users are more affected by perceived risks. These findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions that address demographic variations, enhance user satisfaction, and balance cost-effectiveness with safety assurances. This study provides insights into actionable strategies for policymakers and industry leaders to promote AV adoption and support the evolution of sustainable urban mobility systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autonomous vehicles; commuters’ acceptance; consumer perception; extended UTAUT2 model; sustainable mobility","behavioral response; cost analysis; public attitude; remotely operated vehicle; risk perception; social mobility; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea"

With AI’s rapid advancement impacting productivity and efficiency across industries, understanding the challenges that SMEs face to remain competitive is crucial. Utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as a theoretical framework, we analyzed managers, engineers, and line workers’ observations on workforce challenges, training needs, and opportunities faced by SMEs to provide insights into their smart manufacturing deployment experiences. Our findings highlight social influence’s role in promoting technology adoption, emphasizing community, shared experiences, and collaborative networks. Conversely, effort expectancy emerged as the largest inhibitor, with concerns about the complexity, time, and resources required for implementation. Individuals were also influenced by factors of facilitating conditions (organizational buy-in, infrastructure, etc.) and performance expectancy on their propensity to adopt advanced technology. By fostering positive organizational environments and communities that share success stories and challenges, we suggest this can mitigate the perceived effort expected to implement new technology. In turn, SMEs can better leverage AI and other advanced technologies to maintain global competitiveness.

This study investigates public acceptance of Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) systems in Brunei Darussalam for non-potable uses and ablution purposes. Using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework, the research evaluates key factors influencing public perceptions, including Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude Towards Use (ATU), Intentions to Use (ITU), and external factors such as Perceived Cost (PC), Subjective Knowledge (SK), and Technical Requirements (TR). Survey data were analyzed through regression techniques to assess these relationships. The results validate the TAM framework for understanding acceptance of RWH systems and highlight strong positive relationships between PEU, PU, and ATU, with ATU emerging as the strongest predictor of behavioral intentions (ITU). External factors like PC and TR were identified as barriers to adoption, emphasizing the need for financial incentives and technical support. Additionally, subjective knowledge was found to positively influence PU and ITU, underscoring the importance of public awareness campaigns. While concerns about the safety and quality of recycled rainwater were present, they were not significant deterrents to acceptance. The findings also reveal broad support for initiatives such as education, technical guidance, and maintenance services to enhance adoption. Muslim respondents expressed positive attitudes toward using rainwater for ablution, aligning with religious principles of water conservation. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and relevant agencies to promote RWH systems as a sustainable water management solution, aligning with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and 13 (Climate Action). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ablution; feasibility study; public acceptance; rainwater harvesting; technology acceptance model","feasibility study; harvesting; maintenance; perception; public attitude; rainwater; technology adoption; water management; young population; Borneo; Brunei Darussalam"

Consequently, there is an urgent need to reinforce public policies to mitigate the risk of mortality associated with air pollution. The concept of the value of a statistical life (VSL) serves as a decision-support tool in the formulation of such policies. The VSL is derived from a contingent valuation survey, which assesses individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risk of death linked to air pollution, using a representative sample of the French population. This study’s findings indicate that various factors shape the WTP for risk reduction. These include perceived characteristics, such as the temporality and magnitude of pollution-related damages, the level of awareness regarding these harms, and the degree of individual exposure. Personal and behavioural factors, including age, income, place of residence, and the adoption of preventive measures, also play a significant role. The estimated average VSL ranges from €0.085 million to €0.158 million. These results highlight, first and foremost, a widespread public acceptance of measures to mitigate this risk as citizens demonstrate a readiness to contribute financially. Secondly, they emphasise the extent to which the French population recognises the economic and societal benefits of public health investments to reduce mortality caused by air pollution. The study suggests stricter air quality standards and economic incentives, such as pollution taxes and subsidies for clean technologies, to reduce mortality risks from air pollution and align government expenditures with societal priorities for health and environmental conservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air pollution; contingent evaluation; public policy; value of statistical life; willingness to pay","atmospheric pollution; mortality; willingness to pay; World Health Organization; France"

Activities and practices at the farm level are important for the sustainability credentials of beef supply chains. Therefore, understanding and working with the perceptions, attitudes and motivations of those managing grazing lands and rangelands are critical to sustainability efforts. This study draws on a survey of 367 Australian beef producers to determine typologies of worldviews and attitudes that influence how industry engages both externally and internally with sustainability. The analysis identified four groups of beef producers on the basis of their perceptions of their industry's sustainability, public support, and attitudes towards industry emissions. Two groups (referred to as Vulnerable majority and OK with the status quo) were very positive in their views of industry sustainability and were less concerned about their industry's greenhouse gas emissions and associated challenges. The other two groups (labelled Moderate quarter and Open minority), although still reasonably positive in their view of industry sustainability, were more likely to acknowledge industry greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related challenges. Producer attitudes to public perceptions, and the degree to which they feel public support for their industry, had a significant influence in separating out the groups identified in this study. The findings have implications for engaging producers and the success of programs and policies designed to influence acceptance, and adoption, of sustainability-related technologies and practices.

The study identified the structural elements of social representations of cultured meat, categorizing them into central core and peripheral schemes. Omnivores and vegetarians/vegans demonstrated differing representations and attitudes toward cultured meat, influenced by their dietary choices and beliefs. The research highlighted the role of cognitive processes and sensory perceptions in shaping opinions and willingness to consume cultured meat. What is the implication of the main finding? The findings emphasize the importance of promoting balanced public discussions and informed policymaking regarding cultured meat to increase its societal acceptance. Differentiated outreach strategies may be needed to address the distinct concerns and preferences of omnivores versus vegetarians/vegans. Insights into sensory and cognitive anchors can guide the development and marketing of cultured meat to align more closely with consumer expectations. Considering socio-cultural variables and symbolic meanings associated with food is critical for the successful integration of novel food technologies into diverse communities. In recent years, many studies have examined “novel foods” from various perspectives; however, the theoretical framework of social representations has been underutilized in this research. This paper denotes an initial attempt to study the socio-symbolic impact of synthetic foods using this framework. Specifically, the study aims to explore how different audiences—such as carnivores versus vegetarians—interpret unfamiliar foods, focusing on a new food technology: synthetic meat. The research seeks to describe and compare the social representations of cultured meat that are co-constructed and shared among these social groups (n = 350). The study adopts the structural approach, analyzing both the structure and content of the social representations in question. This was achieved through a mixed-methods strategy, which included hierarchical evocation, a food neophobia scale, checklists, open-ended questions, and a projective sensory analysis technique. Data analysis employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The main findings indicate the significant roles of generative processes, cognitive polyphasia, and sensory anchors in the co-construction of social representations of cultured meat. The use of chemical-genetic objectification, metaphors, and clichés reflects ongoing debates about the possible implications of synthetic meat consumption for the environment and society. Our findings encourage consideration of social knowledge and cultural variables in food studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","central nucleus theory; cognitive polyphasia; consumer acceptance; generative processes; meat production; mixed methods","Central nucleus theory; Cognitive polyphasium; Consumer acceptance; Cultural variables; Generative process; Meat production; Mixed method; Novel foods; Social representations; Structural elements; Meats"

The research is grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Data were collected through a structured questionnaire distributed to 551 professionals across various sectors in Bangladesh, yielding 330 usable responses. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses. The quantitative approach facilitated a comprehensive examination of direct and mediated relationships between constructs. The findings indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions significantly influence behavioral intentions to adopt AI. Attitudes toward AI were found to mediate the relationship between these factors and the intention to use AI. Notably, performance expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions had the strongest effects on behavioral intention, while effort expectancy was also important predictors. The study is limited by its reliance on self-reported data, which may be subject to social desirability bias. Future research could explore longitudinal designs and additional factors such as organizational culture and environmental influences. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and organizational leaders to develop targeted strategies that promote AI adoption among professionals in developing countries.

However, its significant impact on livestock animals often goes underdiscussed as more focus is given to impact of livestock production on climate change. Implementing high-welfare systems, such as digital monitoring of animals, can help mitigate climate-related challenges by reducing temperature fluctuations and controlling disease spread. Despite the potential benefits, consumer acceptance of this digital innovation remains uncertain. This study examines consumer attitudes toward digitally monitored animal welfare practices, aiming to understand their acceptance and the values they associate with these practices. It investigates the role of digital technology in enhancing consumer decision-making by addressing animal welfare concerns. Using means-end chain theory and Schwartz's value typology, the research explores the motivational layers and product attributes tied to consumer values. Semi-structured interviews with twenty pork consumers revealed hierarchical relationships between product attributes, benefits, and values. Analysis through NVivo 14 and LadderUX software generated themes and a hierarchical value map. The findings indicate that consumers prioritise attributes such as animal diets, stress-free environments, humane processing practices, and health conditions, linking these to both ethical and hedonic values. Intrinsic attributes like product appearance and freshness are crucial for at-home consumption decisions, while sustainable packaging also plays a role. The study also found differences in consumer behaviour based on the consumption context, with ethical decision-making often shifting to restaurateurs when dining out. The research underscores the importance of transparency, ethical practices, and product quality in influencing consumer decisions, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies that promote ethical consumption and improve animal welfare standards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; age; animal welfare; article; climate; climate change; consumer; consumer attitude; decision making; diet; digital technology; ecosystem; ethical decision making; food intake; human; livestock; male; marketing; nonhuman; packaging; physiological stress; pork; product quality; semi structured interview; temperature; aged; animal; attitude; ethics; female; food preference; meat; middle aged; pig; psychology; young adult; Adult; Aged; Animal Welfare; Animals; Attitude; Climate Change; Consumer Behavior; Decision Making; Digital Technology; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Meat Products; Middle Aged; Swine; Young Adult"

It integrates the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches to assess the relationships among constructs. For the F-DEMATEL, opinions were collected from 20 experts in the environmental field, while SEM and ANN data were gathered from 1726 participants in Taiwan. F-DEMATEL results demonstrated causal relationships between external factors (perceived trust, self-efficacy, and perceived awareness) and the main variables of the TAM. Likewise, SEM results revealed that perceived trust (PT), self-efficacy (SE), and perceived awareness (PA) influence the main variables of TAM. However, the direct relationships between PT and behavioral intention (BI) and PA and BI were not significant. PT and PA indirectly influence BI through perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). The results also established that BI positively influences pro-environmental behavior.

Here we describe how engaging stakeholders into a collaborative process led to the successful translation of new eDNA findings into conservation outcomes. We characterized the distribution of three federally listed pond-breeding amphibians across nearly 200 wetlands in coastal California using both traditional field surveys and eDNA sampling; the latter had greater detection rates overall. Regulatory agency staff gained trust in the rigor and effectiveness of eDNA data by joining traditional surveys and through the collaborative development of recommendations for the adoption of eDNA methods. Extensive outreach to the local community within the range of the highly endangered Santa Cruz long-toed salamander resulted in invitations to sample previously unsurveyed wetlands on private property and the detection of new breeding sites. Conservation organizations and resource management agencies were integrated into our core team from the start, and ultimately shaped wetland management actions, siting of new wetlands, and land acquisition priorities informed by the data generated.

This technology has seen widespread adoption across various sectors of society and is anticipated to revolutionise the educational landscape, especially in the domain of tertiary education. However, there is a gap in understanding factors influencing university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI, leading to hesitation in its adoption. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the factors that influence university students' behavioural intention to engage with and utilise generative AI. The study sought to delve into the fundamental reasons and obstacles that university students encounter when contemplating the adoption of this technology for their academic endeavours. Methods: The study used a quantitative research design, utilising a revised version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Data were collected from a sample of 380 university students in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan in China. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the relationships between the variables of the model, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), learning value, habit and behavioural intention. Results: The analysis revealed that PE and EE have a direct impact on learning value. Additionally, SI and FC were found to directly affect the formation of habit. Among these factors, learning value emerged as the most potent predictor of university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI. Habit also demonstrated a significant, albeit smaller, effect on behavioural intention. Conclusions: The study's findings underscore the importance of learning value in driving the adoption of generative AI among university students. Efforts to enhance the learning value of generative AI could significantly increase its uptake in higher education. Furthermore, the role of habit, while less pronounced, suggests that consistent exposure and use can foster a greater inclination towards generative AI. These insights provide a foundation for targeted interventions aimed at improving the integration and application of generative AI within educational settings. Stakeholders, including educators, policymakers and designers of generative AI, can leverage these findings to create an environment conducive to the adoption and effective use of generative AI in higher education. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavioural intention; generative AI; PLS-SEM; university students; UTAUT2",""

However, widespread adoption of CAVs will still require a considerable amount of time due to constraints such as technological development, legal regulations, and social acceptance. During the transitional period of CAVs’ proliferation, road traffic will comprise vehicles with different levels of connection and automation. These vehicles will differ in technology regarding communication, perception, decision-making, and other aspects, potentially posing severe challenges to mixed traffic flow safety. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mixed traffic flow model from both automation and connection perspectives to consider time delay and communication degradation. Four safety evaluation metrics are employed, and three-speed scenarios are set to investigate the influence of connection levels, automation levels, and their combined effects on mixed traffic flow safety. The result shows that (1) low automation enhances traffic safety in a non-connected environment, whereas medium and high automation decreases traffic safety. Conversely, in a connected environment, the role of automation levels exhibits the opposite pattern. (2) non-connected vehicles enhance traffic safety in a low-automated environment, while connected vehicles diminish it. However, connection level effects are reversed in medium and highly automated environments. (3) In connected and automated environments, traffic safety is increased by non-connected and low-automated vehicles, connected and medium automated vehicles, and connected and highly automated vehicles. However, other vehicle configurations decrease traffic safety. (4) Across various scenarios, the integration of connection and high automation proves beneficial for reducing traffic collision risks and improving traffic safety. In summary, this study provides theoretical support for managing and controlling mixed traffic flow with different automation and connection levels in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Connected automated vehicles; Levels of automation; Levels of connection; Safety evaluation; Time delay","Automatic vehicle identification; Automated environments; Automated vehicles; Automation levels; Connected automated vehicle; Level of connection; Levels of automation; Mixed traffic flow; Safety evaluations; Time-delays; Traffic safety; Vehicle safety"

Specifically, we develop a contextualized model that extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) by leveraging a mixed-methods approach and, therefore, conducting three studies. The so-developed contextualized model of consumer adoption of sustainable technology is tested using 2003 observations from five European countries. Such a sample also provides the opportunity for a cross-country comparison. We found that habit, environmental knowledge, information provision, and innovativeness were significant predictors of sustainable technology use. Additionally, the cross-country comparison revealed that although conclusions are generally consistent across the countries, they differ in some effects, like social influence and price value. Taken together, we thus provide insights into the consumers' motivations to adopt and use sustainable technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy; Mixed-methods research; Sustainable technology; Technology adoption; UTAUT2","Sustainable city; Country comparisons; Energy; Mixed-methods research; Sustainable behaviours; Sustainable efforts; Sustainable technology; Technology adoption; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2; United Nations; Sustainable development goals"

Most existing empirical works have been undertaken in western contexts, and they do not consider country-origin influence. Thus, they are of little benefit to global and transnational organizations. Awareness of countries’ similarities and contrasts provides the basis for understanding people’s behaviors in cross-cultural contexts, which can be crucial to ensuring technology acceptance and success, especially in multinational organizations. Our research aims to explain why and how people use SNSs sustainably in the workplace through a model and comparative study. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical framework was developed to integrate and extend two major behavioral adoption and technology use models in explaining SNS use continuance. This paper collected data through a survey and analyzed it using structural equation modeling through partial least squares (PLS). Findings: One major contribution of this study is to highlight that the users in selected countries are driven strongly by subconscious factors rather than traditional factors based on the system attributes and users’ perceived rationality of continuing to use SNSs. Research limitations/implications: This paper recommends that the model in this study be tested in other technology environments to evaluate the external validity of the research study. The research was based on an unspecified platform, but each SNS may have its own singularities that should merit further consideration.

This paper challenges this assumption and argues that technology frameworks may require new variables to capture consumers' preferences. A UTAUT2-based study has been developed to assess the role of environmental concern in the BEVs context and put forward the technology show-off (TS) concept to explain the technology's acceptance. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative and cross-sectional look at behavioral intention is adopted. The study uses structural equation modeling to analyze a sample of 236 Macau residents to determine the relevance of the factors behind the choice to adopt BEVs. Findings: The findings indicate that environmental concern and price may be relevant to explain behavioral intention to adopt the BEVs technology. Furthermore, the UTAUT2 framework seems to benefit from adding new variables, with TS playing a pertinent role in explaining technology acceptance. Social implications: The findings show that environmental concern fails to build an argument for the shift to full electric mobility and promote the desired behavioral change toward adopting BEVs. Herein lies the necessity to consider new variables that can better describe the characteristics of modern society.

By extending the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, the research explores traditional and novel constructs impacting the acceptance of this delivery technology. Research Design, Data, and Methodology: The study develops a model combining DOI theory constructs (relative advantage, complexity, compatibility) with factors like hedonic motivation, trust, social awkwardness, and public environment impact. A survey of Chinese consumers assessed their adoption intentions for ADVs, focusing on willingness to trial, preferences, and daily integration, analyzed through statistical methods. Results: Findings show relative advantage as the strongest adoption predictor, while complexity hinders adoption, emphasizing user-friendly designs. Compatibility with habits significantly impacts adoption. Social awkwardness suggests reducing social interactions can enhance ADVs’ appeal, highlighting the importance of both traditional and novel factors in promoting ADV adoption. Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of both traditional and new factors in promoting ADV adoption. Service providers should focus on improving operational efficiency, simplifying usage, and ensuring compatibility with consumer behaviors. The findings also suggest that reducing social interactions could enhance the appeal of autonomous services, aligning with changing societal attitudes toward privacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Delivery Vehicle; Consumer Acceptance; Diffusion of Innovations Theory; Structural Equation Modeling",""

Motivated by the ubiquitous challenges our world is facing, this initiative had the goal to explore six main issues from an interdisciplinary perspective with a focus on the UN SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities” and the HCI Grand Challenge 2 “Human-Environment Interactions.” The six issues were formulated as questions and presented to the participants working in small groups. (1) How to create inclusive and ethical smart cities? (2) How to establish trust between people and smart environments? (3) How to address privacy concerns in smart environments that adopt the “disappearing computer” paradigm? (4) How to promote explainability and transparency of policies and measures to citizens of smart cities or in smart environments in general? (5) How to design incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior in smart cities at a personal as well as collective/corporate level? (6) How to measure success and impact in sustainable smart city projects? The method and approach of the Design Café is a tailored composition of a guided, structured format combined with and inspired by processes of informal communication and exchange of knowledge and ideas. Aligned moderation, a minimum set of rules, a set of relevant topics and an interdisciplinary group of motivated participants working in rotating formations provides the structure for achieving results. The results show that the six issues are not independent of each other, but require a holistic view, considering the various dependencies as well as synergies when exploring solutions. Nevertheless, the importance of first establishing higher-level goals based on ethical and inclusive approaches fostering human dignity and human rights were key. Acceptance of overall goals, processes, rules, and regulations was considered as the fundamental pre-requisite for sustainable change towards a declared goal. Acceptance needs trust and privacy as well as explainability and transparency of policies and measures. The role of incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior was twofold. Offering incentives must include planning on how to measure their impact. Effective measurement of success and impact depends heavily on how the institutions address privacy. Explainability and transparency should become one of the ethical guidelines that steer and control concepts, decision making, and implementations of all activities. The scale of these societal challenges still needs to be recognized by those responsible. It is essential to educate decision makers in the psychological needs and effects of sense making, comprehensibility, and finally acceptance and well-being moving towards a humanity-centered design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; cooperative city; design café; disappearing computer; ethics; explainability; explainable AI; HCI grand challenges; human- and citizen-centered design; human-centered AI; Human-environment interaction; humane city; humanity-centered design; incentives and rewards for sustainable behavior; inclusiveness; information design, knowledge design; measuring success and impact; observability; participatory design; privacy; quintuple helix; smart city; smart environments; sustainability; sustainable behavior; sustainable cities and communities; transparency; trust; UN SDGs","Artificial intelligence; Data privacy; Ethical technology; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Smart city; Sustainable development; Cooperative city; Design cafe; Design knowledge; Disappearing computers; Explainability; Explainable AI; Grand Challenge; HCI grand challenge; Human- and citizen-centered design; Human-centered AI; Human-environment interaction; Humane city; Humanity-centered design; Incentive and reward for sustainable behavior; Inclusiveness; Information design; Information design, knowledge design; Measuring success and impact; Participatory design; Privacy; Quintuple helix; Smart environment; Sustainable behaviours; Sustainable cities; Sustainable communities; Trust; UN SDG; Transparency"

As the population ages, AI-based health technologies could be a potent tool in older adults’ health care to address growing, complex, and challenging health needs. This study aimed to investigate perspectives on and acceptability of the use of AI-led health technologies among older adults and the potential challenges that they face in adopting them. The findings from this inquiry could inform the designing of more acceptable and user-friendly AI-based health technologies. Objective: The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the attitudes and perceptions of older adults toward the use of AI-based health technologies; (2) to identify potential facilitators, barriers, and challenges influencing older adults’ preferences toward AI-based health technologies; and (3) to inform strategies that can promote and facilitate the use of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design. A total of 27 community-dwelling older adults were recruited from a local community center. Three sessions of semistructured interviews were conducted, each lasting 1 hour. The sessions covered five key areas: (1) general impressions of AI-based health technologies; (2) previous experiences with AI-based health technologies; (3) perceptions and attitudes toward AI-based health technologies; (4) anticipated difficulties in using AI-based health technologies and underlying reasons; and (5) willingness, preferences, and motivations for accepting AI-based health technologies. Thematic analysis was applied for data analysis. The Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model behavior change wheel were integrated into the analysis. Identified theoretical domains were mapped directly to the COM-B model to determine corresponding strategies for enhancing the acceptability of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Results: The analysis identified 9 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework domains—knowledge, skills, social influences, environmental context and resources, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, intentions, goals, and emotion. These domains were mapped to 6 components of the COM-B model. While most participants acknowledged the potential benefits of AI-based health technologies, they emphasized the irreplaceable role of human expertise and interaction. Participants expressed concerns about the usability of AI technologies, highlighting the need for user-friendly and tailored AI solutions. Privacy concerns and the importance of robust security measures were also emphasized as critical factors affecting their willingness to adopt AI-based health technologies. Conclusions: Integrating AI as a supportive tool alongside health care providers, rather than regarding it as a replacement, was highlighted as a key strategy for promoting acceptance. Government support and clear guidelines are needed to promote ethical AI implementation in health care. These measures can improve health outcomes in the older adult population by encouraging the adoption of AI-driven health technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceptability; aging; AI; AI-based health technology; algorithm; analytics; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence–based health technologies; elderly; geriatrics; gerontology; health technology; machine learning; ML; mobile phone; model; older adult; older people; older person; perceptions",""

The study investigates the links between exposure to fluoride narratives, learners' attitudes about fluoride narratives, engagement with AI-based platforms, and perceived utility of AI-generated information by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the study looks at how AI involvement and attitudes affect knowledge retention through serial and mediating effects. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey approach with students in China's Jiangxi and Henan provinces as its target population. The relationship between exposure to fluoride narratives in educational materials, perceptions of the value of AI-generated information, interaction with AI platforms, and knowledge retention was examined through the application of structural equation modeling, or SEM. The pathways in the Technology Acceptance Model were examined using cross-sectional and serial mediation analyses. Of particular interest was the effect of AI-driven educational material on attitudes and engagement that lead to knowledge retention. Results: The results show that learners' views regarding fluoride and their engagement with AI platforms are greatly impacted when they are exposed to fluoride narratives in instructional content. These elements also highly predict the memory of fluoride-related knowledge. The study shows that the association between knowledge retention and the perceived utility of AI-generated information is entirely mediated by positive sentiments regarding the narratives and involvement with AI-based learning platforms. The impact of AI-generated material on knowledge retention is contingent upon learners' attitudes and their degree of involvement with AI platforms, as demonstrated by serial mediation studies. Research Limitation/Implication: Since the cross-sectional methodology makes it difficult to determine causal linkages, further longitudinal research is required to fully comprehend the long-term impacts of AI-enhanced instructional content on knowledge retention. To improve the study's validity, more objective measures of engagement and information retention should be included in subsequent studies. Orginality: This work presents a unique use of TAM in the context of educational technology, focusing on how AI-generated material might support learning experiences that are narrative-driven and culturally rich. This work contributes to the understanding of how technology acceptance affects information retention within the context of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales by mapping the intermediary processes of learner attitudes and AI engagement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-Based Learning Platforms; AI-Generated Instructional Content; Fluoride Narratives; Knowledge Retention; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)","fluoride; adolescent; Article; artificial intelligence; attitude to health; child; college student; Cronbach alpha coefficient; cross-sectional study; curriculum; demographics; discriminant validity; educational technology; environmental science; female; human; hypothesis; independent variable; knowledge; learning environment; Likert scale; male; methodology; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; online shopping; public health; social media; structural equation modeling; temperature; virtual learning environment"

To address this, the study investigates how community education influences elderly engagement in digital backfeeding—a process where younger generations assist older adults with digital skills—by examining the interplay of personal, technological, and community factors in promoting technology acceptance. Using an integrated framework of the UTAUT, TTF, and TAM models, the research surveyed 482 elderly participants in community centers in Taiyuan, China, focusing on variables such as task and technology characteristics, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and technology anxiety. Analysis through AMOS and SPSS Process macro revealed that task characteristics significantly enhance engagement willingness, although technology characteristics introduce certain challenges. Furthermore, social influence and facilitating conditions were found to positively affect willingness and behavior, mediated by perceived usefulness, ease of use, and technology anxiety. Notably, participatory digital skills exhibited a stronger moderating effect on engagement willingness compared to receptive skills. These findings underscore the pivotal role of community education in fostering digital inclusion among the elderly. Practical recommendations include simplifying technology interfaces, creating supportive environments, and prioritizing participatory skills development to enhance technology acceptance, offering valuable insights for the design of age-friendly digital tools that bridge the digital divide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","age-friendly design; aging; community education; digital backfeeding; digital skills; technology acceptance model",""

To enhance the model’s predictiveness, we included variables from the Model of Goal-Directed Behavior—attitude, anticipated emotions, and desire— as well as sociodemographic factors. 511 participants completed an online survey in which they evaluated a customized app designed to promote sustainable eating. Results showed that performance expectancy was the strongest predictor of attitude, anticipated emotions, and intention, whereas effort expectancy was not. Social influence and facilitating conditions predicted desire, which in turn predicted intention, and thus led to app download. Facilitating conditions and emotions were more influencial for women, older participants showed a higher desire despite high effort expectation, and those with higher education levels downloaded the app more due its perceived ease of use. These findings suggest that developers should focus on enhancing the emotional appeal and perceived value of the app while addressing the users’ diverse needs based on gender, age, and education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","app download; digital tools; Environmental Psychology; European Studies; psychosocial predictors; Social Psychology; Sustainable eating; technology adoption",""

Thus, there is a strong need to improve the efficiency of freight transportation and reduce environmental impacts by using emerging technologies. This study aims to explore the perceived usefulness of using Autonomous Trucks in logistics in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Data were collected using an online survey from 72 members of the Trucking Associations in the U.S. states of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The participants' perceptions were captured using 14 pre-determined perceived usefulness on a five-point level of agreement. A Likert scale was developed based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics Software—Version 29. The results showed mixed perceived usefulness. Items related to efficiency were mostly supported, and items related to effectiveness were mostly neutral. Items related to overall satisfaction were mostly not supported. In addition, some participant groups reported higher levels of agreement with the examined items than others. For example, those who worked in a business with 500 employees or more, had much knowledge of autonomous trucks, worked in sales, had two or fewer years of work experience, and worked in a business with international market coverage. In addition, participants who worked in businesses transporting agriculture, food, and livestock cargo reported higher levels of agreement with the examined perceived usefulness than those who worked in companies transporting construction, fuel, machinery, waste, and mixed freight. This study contributes to the academic literature by adding more insights about the perceived usefulness of autonomous trucks in logistics. The results would benefit academics, researchers, logisticians, supply chain managers, autonomous truck manufacturers, policymakers, and other interested stakeholders. They can also help develop future research projects in a similar domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autonomous trucks; Gulf Coast; logistics; perceived usefulness; technology acceptance model (TAM); United States","efficiency measurement; freight transport; perception; trucking; unmanned vehicle; Gulf Coast [United States]; United States"

As delays in care have been associated with inferior outcomes, same-day appointments have been proposed as a patient-centric means of improving healthcare delivery. However, this paradigm represents a radical shift from conventional scheduling tactics, and skepticism has long existed regarding its feasibility and real-world applicability to clinical practice. Given the limited data available about same-day access and the lack of guidance on this strategy, the need to evaluate experiences and engage in introspective reflection (i.e., examine thoughts, emotions, judgments, and perceptions) for quality improvement are paramount. Thus, the purpose of this study was to review a single-institutional practice with same-day access, focusing on lessons learned over a two-year period. Methods: From March 2021 to March 2023, a total of 4,301 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed cancer were offered same-day appointments as part of a prospective pilot initiative conducted in the outpatient setting at a tertiary-based academic medical center. Systematic analysis demonstrated the positive impact of this initiative on access-related benchmarks. A retrospective review was conducted to identify core themes pertaining to the feasibility of the initiative with respect to its design and implementation. An interpretive synthesis was then presented in descriptive fashion. Principal Findings: Of the 3,414 patients scheduled, 477 (14%) opted for same-day appointments. While same-day appointments significantly reduced the time to consultation and treatment for patients with newly diagnosed cancer, the initiative presented new challenges-both expected and unexpected-that could have hindered its development, acceptance, and adoption. These challenges related to scheduling capacity, logistical coordination, workflow efficiency, resource allocation, and cultural change. A consistent, proactive management approach, coupled with an unwavering commitment to communication, was required to overcome these operational barriers. Practical Applications: Same-day appointments in the ambulatory setting has the potential to improve health outcomes and care quality, while fundamentally changing the way healthcare is delivered for the betterment of patients. However, thoughtful preparation and team-based planning are imperative to establish a methodical approach that will optimize the likelihood of success. Given the potentially disruptive nature of this paradigm, the need for steady leadership, accompanied by the consistent promotion of standardized guidelines, is critical to ensure engagement among all stakeholders. Lastly, the importance of promoting positive cultural change and creating an environment of shared purpose, trust, and transparency cannot be overemphasized. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Article; assistive technology; balanced scorecard; clinical practice guideline; consultation time; coordination; cultural factor; data collection method; health care access; health care delivery; human; institutional care; interpersonal communication; leadership; management style; marketing; outpatient; patience; patient attendance; patient scheduling; resource allocation; same day appointment; stakeholder engagement; total quality management; adult; aged; female; hospital management; male; middle aged; neoplasm; organization and management; pilot study; prospective study; therapy; time factor; Adult; Aged; Appointments and Schedules; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Quality Improvement; Time Factors"

Given that researchers' interactions with and perceptions of these technologies can substantially influence academic procedures and outputs, identifying the key determinants of their incorporation into university environments is crucial. This investigation pursued two main objectives: first, to identify the variables that condition the implementation of AI models in research activities, and second, to analyze how perceived ethical considerations and academic integrity influence their adoption. The empirical study was conducted through a digital survey administered to 302 academic researchers from Peruvian public and private universities. The analytical methodology employed structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, grounded in an expanded version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model. The results demonstrated that six out of nine hypotheses were supported; social influence, educational self-efficacy, and academic integrity were identified as primary factors predicting researchers' use of AI models. Effort expectancy had a significant negative effect on AI model use. Furthermore, the use of AI models was found to significantly influence both teachers' concerns and perceived ethics among academics. Notably, performance expectancy, technological self-efficacy, and personal anxiety did not significantly affect AI model use. This study contributes to the understanding of AI adoption in academic research by highlighting the importance of social, educational, and ethical factors. These findings have implications for developing policies and training programs to promote responsible AI use in higher education and suggest a need to reevaluate traditional technology acceptance models in the context of AI in academia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academic researchers; Artificial intelligence; Educational technology; Higher education; UTAUT2",""

Although virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in addressing spatial comprehension challenges, questions remain regarding its effectiveness in supporting collaborative learning and sustained knowledge retention. This longitudinal study examined Collaborative Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (C-IVAL), an innovative VR platform designed to enhance traditional anatomy learning through integrated collaborative features, immersive technology, and serious game elements. We conducted an experimental study with 65 medical students to evaluate their knowledge acquisition and technology acceptance compared to its non-collaborative predecessor, the Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (IVAL). Our evaluation framework combined quantitative assessments (knowledge tests, comprising pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) analysis. Knowledge assessment revealed significant cognitive improvements, with mean knowledge scores increasing from 2.48 to 3.94 in the immediate post-tests, while long-term retention of anatomy knowledge showed sustained engagement for over two months. Importantly, C-IVAL demonstrated significantly higher scores across all TAM dimensions than the non-collaborative IVAL system, particularly for perceived usefulness and intention to use. Post-session feedback analysis showed 73.8% positive responses, highlighting enhanced social presence, immersive engagement, and effective collaboration, with 26.2% of constructive feedback focusing on system refinement and feature enhancement.

The aim is to be more effective and efficient by doing more with less by managing all the organisation's resources. The ways in which organisations face these economic, social, and environmental challenges vary according to their activity. Globalisation has enabled economic growth, allowing the expansion of markets and access to goods and services worldwide. This has led to an increased level of global competition among organisations and the search for markets in which they have no competitors. In most cases they find markets with several players competing for a market with increasingly lower margins and trying to survive by seeking new competitive advantages. Purpose: The priority objective is to analyse the owner vs employee's perception of artificial intelligence and how it impacts the relationship with the sustainability of the company. For this purpose, a Likert survey has been carried out, which is an effective tool to evaluate this type of perception in a quantitative way. Today it is a strategic area for organisations, and this perception and employee behaviour are key to its proper functioning. Structure: The introductory section explains where the data comes from, explaining what is known, what is new and the aim of the work. This is followed by the research methodology applied, together with the criteria for selecting the data sets and categories. Finally, the conclusions section highlights the results obtained, their implications along with their limitations and possible future directions of the research. Findings: Sustainability in organisations is important in the generation and application of ideas and a novel perspective that drives organisational growth and contributes to sustainability, maintaining a balance between the three main dimensions, economic, social, and environmental. Innovation generates the creation of products, services or processes that reduce environmental impact, among others, promoting efficiency and the preservation of resources in the search for economic benefits. These technologies include green technologies, recycling strategies and renewable energies. The use of advanced technologies by organisations in their quest to achieve higher levels of sustainability offers a range of benefits that would otherwise be inaccessible. The integration of tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation into business processes not only optimises operational efficiency, but also contributes significantly to environmental and economic sustainability. These technologies facilitate data-driven decision-making, improve resource management, and reduce waste, which is crucial for sustainable development. In addition, AI and automation can play a vital role in identifying opportunities for sustainable innovation, enabling organisations to proactively adapt to changing market demands and environmental regulations. However, it is essential to consider the ethical and social implications of these technologies, especially in terms of labour impact and data privacy. In this context, the need arises to explore the internal impact of AI and automation in organisations, specifically how these technologies are perceived by different actors within the company, such as owners and workers. To investigate this aspect, the use of Machine Learning Language Models (LLMs) represents a valuable methodological tool. By implementing LLMs, the aim is to compare the perceptions of owners and workers on several issues related to automation in the business environment. This includes aspects such as acceptance of the technology, perceived impact on productivity and well-being at work, and expectations regarding changes in work dynamics. This research could shed light on the discrepancies or overlaps in the perceptions of these groups, offering a deeper understanding of the socio-economic and cultural impact of automation and AI on organisations. Discussion: Today, it is necessary to manage the acquisition, creation, and application of knowledge differently from the way it was done until the last century. The organisation must be creative as it is essential for subsistence and for the development of sustainable strategies. Today, disruptive changes in technology are happening almost continuously. The research has revealed important results in terms of the perception of automation in the business environment, highlighting differences and alignments in the perspectives of employees and business owners. Artificial intelligence is beginning to have a priority place in the structure of the organisation, where they replace employees or create symbiotic relationships with optimal results. This allows organisations to keep up with such a revolutionary environment, identify opportunities to optimise processes by automating processes, reducing waste, and promoting ethical and socially responsible business practices in a world increasingly concerned with these aspects. Originality: The research in question, which uses a Machine Learning Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to question perceptions of automation in a business environment, represents an innovative approach in the field of automation research. The use of an LLM to collect and analyse data offers a novel and efficient perspective, allowing for a more dynamic and in-depth analysis of the responses obtained. This methodology is distinguished by its ability to process and interpret a significant volume of qualitative data at a speed and with an accuracy that traditional survey methods cannot match. By using Likert-scale questions and analyzing responses from two different perspectives - that of business leaders and that of employees - the research addresses the complexity of perceptions of automation in a holistic manner. This dual approach allows us to identify not only the differences between these two groups, but also potential areas of alignment, providing a more nuanced view of how automation is perceived and experienced at different levels of the organisation. The advantages of this methodology are multiple. Firstly, using an LLM such as ChatGPT to analyse survey responses allows for a more detailed and nuanced interpretation of the data, especially in terms of capturing and understanding the subtleties of language and emotions implicit in the responses. In addition, the ability to process large datasets quickly and efficiently facilitates broader and more representative analysis, which can lead to more robust and reliable conclusions. In practical terms, this approach can help organisations better understand the attitudes and concerns of their employees and leaders regarding automation, which in turn can inform more effective implementation and change management strategies. It also provides valuable insights for the development of policies and practices that encourage a more harmonious and ethical integration of automation in the workplace, maximising its benefits while minimising potential negative impacts on staff. Practical implications: Studies on the perception of automation in the business context, both from the point of view of employees and owners, underline the need for adapted and differentiated approaches to integrating automation in the workplace. It highlights the divergent needs and concerns of these groups, suggesting that automation implementation strategies should not only focus on operational efficiency, but also address employee concerns about job security and the relevance of skills. This includes integrating training and professional development as key components of automation programmes, making sure that employees feel equipped and valued in the evolving automated workspace. In addition, the results highlight the importance of effective and transparent communication about the goals and impacts of automation and advocate the joint involvement of employees and managers in the design and implementation of automated solutions. Taken as a whole, the study emphasises the need for holistic and empathetic management of automation in organisations, viewing technology to improve the working environment and support employees' professional growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business innovation; Sustainable automation integration; Sustainable business automation; Sustainable business strategies; Workforce sustainability","Automation integration; Business automation; Business innovation; Business strategy; Sustainable automation integration; Sustainable business; Sustainable business automation; Sustainable business strategy; Workforce sustainability; Sustainable development goals; adaptive management; artificial intelligence; automation; business development; employment; machine learning; perception; sustainability; workplace"

Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with 5, 000 bootstrap resamples, the authors assess direct relationships as well as two sequential mediations. The authors present standardized coefficients (β), explained variance (R²), effect sizes (f²) and mediation strength (variance accounted for [VAF]) to quantify practical significance. Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative, cross-sectional design was used, with data gathered from 300 registered nurses through a structured survey. The research model was analyzed using PLS-SEM. Constructs were grounded in the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Findings – The results substantiate all eight hypothesized relationships. TR is found to significantly predict both DHT and IWB and directly influence JP. Furthermore, DHT positively affects both IWB and JP, while IWB exhibits a robust predictive relationship with JP. Mediation analysis indicates that DHT mediates the relationship between TR and IWB, and IWB mediates the relationship between DHT and JP. These findings validate the proposed integrated model and highlight the importance of behavioral mechanisms in digital transformation. Practical implications – Hospital administrators and policymakers should prioritize the enhancement of technological readiness and the fostering of an innovative culture among nursing staff. Effective digital transformation requires both systemic investment and the empowerment of individual behaviors. For health systems in developing countries, infrastructure deficiencies (e.g. intermittent internet and power supply) may weaken downstream connections (DHT → IWB; IWB → JP). The authors delineate strategies for mitigation – including tiered technology readiness-based training, low-bandwidth and offline-first deployment and workflow-integrated enablement – aimed at transforming digital investments into innovative work behaviors and enhanced performance. Originality/value – This study contributes a novel, empirically validated model that links technological readiness and innovative behavior to job performance within the digital health-care framework. This study examines an empirically grounded behavioral pathway that connects technological readiness, digital health transformation, innovative work behavior and job performance among nurses in public hospitals.

Design/methodology/approach – Grounded in the technology acceptance model and utility theory, the research utilizes a quantitative approach based on a structured questionnaire. Data from 379 UAE respondents were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine direct and mediated relationships among AI tools, GFE and SCB. Findings – The study found that AI-assisted tools significantly enhance GFE among UAE residents. This increased engagement, in turn, positively influences SCB, confirming GFE’s mediating role. The results highlight that individuals are more likely to adopt green financial behaviors when AI tools improve accessibility, usability and perceived utility of financial services. Additionally, utility maximization – balancing economic and environmental benefits – plays a key role in motivating sustainable financial decisions. These findings support the integration of AI technologies in promoting eco-conscious financial behavior and offer practical insights for policymakers and financial institutions. Research limitations/implications – This study is constrained by its reliance on data from 379 residents of the United Arab Emirates, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other cultural or regional contexts. Its cross-sectional design further restricts the ability to draw conclusions about causality or changes over time. Moreover, the use of self-reported data introduces the potential for social desirability bias. Originality/value – Unlike prior studies that isolate the effects of AI or green finance on consumer behavior, this research uniquely explores their intersection and the mediating role of green finance engagement. It adds a consumer-centric perspective to the literature on how AI enables sustainable financial behavior by aligning economic benefits with environmental priorities, thus supporting sustainability and digital innovation in the UAE and comparable emerging markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence assisted tools; Environmental and sustainability prioritization; Green finance; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable consumption behavior",""

The current study attempts to show the way how MCDM frameworks and digital twin technology are combined to influence urban planning and infrastructure optimization concerning cultural issues. The current study is about how regional culture influences smart city infrastructure development in northeastern China through a survey-based approach. This research study investigates how cultural values, governance models, and socio-economic conditions influence smart city development by collecting information from urban planners, policymakers, architects, and residents of key cities. The questionnaire aimed to identify stakeholder perceptions regarding integrating traditional architectural elements, local institutional frameworks, and new technologies, such as digital twins and artificial intelligence, into urban planning. The study employs multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to examine the importance of relevance and cultural weightage in the selection of a decision-making framework for development that is aimed at optimizing infrastructure, sustainability, and efficiency. Surveys confirm technology acceptance, but preference toward regional identity through adaptive strategies takes precedence in urban planning. This research shows how computational intelligence aids the differential urban transformation under uncertainty pertaining to decision-making while keeping an eye on culture. Challenges confronting the smart city development processes in the region are those such as change management, gaps in policy, and technological accessibility. The findings suggest that the MCDM’s hybrid decision support systems with stakeholder consultations could enhance smart city project formulation without compromising heritage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin technology; MCDM; regional culture; Smart city infrastructure; stakeholder perceptions","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Digital twin; Regional planning; Smart city; Sustainable city; Sustainable development; Urban growth; 'current; Digital twin technology; Infrastructure development; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-Criterion; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Regional cultures; Smart city infrastructure; Stakeholder perception; Decision support systems"

Previous studies have predominantly employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) or the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to investigate user acceptance, yet few have integrated both frameworks to explore how environmental objectives—such as net-zero emissions (NZE)—influence behavioral intention in smart cities. To address this limitation, the present study incorporates key variables including subjective norms (SN), perceived usefulness (PU), user attitudes (ATU), and perceived behavioral control (PBC), while introducing NZE as a factor in user behavior analysis. Data were collected from 298 urban residents aged 18–54 via an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted to examine the relationships among SN, PU, ATU, PBC, and NZE. The results showed that SN significantly predicted PU, which confirm the strong influence of social factors on user perceptions. PU stands as a mediating variable, and it significantly influenced users’ ATU and NZE, which reflected that users highly value the convenience and environmental benefits of shared e-bikes. In addition, PU is a key factor in users’ understanding and adoption of NZE, demonstrating that a well-designed shared e-bike system can enhance environmental sensitivity and awareness of green behavior. Furthermore, NZE exerted a significant positive impact on PBC, indicating that greater environmental awareness enhances users’ sense of behavioral control, thereby actively motivating them to opt for shared e-bikes. These findings provides empirical evidence and strategic directions for policymakers and urban planners: by strengthening social advocacy, optimizing system usefulness design, and guiding environmental awareness through green policies, cities can more effectively encourage the adoption of shared electric bicycles in smart urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","net zero emissions; shared e-bikes; smart city; structural equation model; theory of planned behavior",""

Building on perceived value and planned behavior theories, this study proposes a moderated mediation model in which perceived value influences both sustainability perception and purchase intentions, with household income, technology trust, and environmental knowledge serving as moderators. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 496 licensed drivers familiar with EVs was conducted using validated multi-item scales. Data were analyzed in R using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (lavaan), incorporating product-indicator interactions and 5,000-sample bootstrapping to test the direct, moderating, and mediating effects. Results: Consumers’ perceived value has a positive effect on sustainability perception (0.122, p < 0.001) and purchase intentions (0.002, p < 0.001). Household income also strengthens the relationship between perceived value and purchase intention (0.043, p < 0.001). Digital innovation (0.285, p < 0.001) and environmental concerns (0.411, p < 0.001) dynamically influenced the perception of sustainability at a significant level, although social influence was not significant. Compared with other variables, sustainability perception had the greatest effect on consumers’ intention to buy an electric car (0.624, p < 0.001) and served as a mediator in three out of four indirect connections between perceived value and purchase intention. The moderating effects of technology trust and environmental knowledge were not supported. Conclusion: These findings highlight the central roles of value and sustainability perceptions in EV adoption and identify income as a key boundary condition. Practical implications include tailoring incentives by income segment, investing in user-centric digital platforms, and emphasizing both economic and environmental benefits. Theoretically, this study extends technology acceptance models by integrating sustainability constructs and underscores the nuanced impact of socioeconomic factors on green consumer behavior. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital innovation; electric vehicles; environmental concerns; moderated mediation; perceived value; purchase intentions; sustainability perception",""

This study focuses on Malaysian secondary physics teachers and employs an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, utilizing questionnaire surveys (n=420), in-depth interviews (n=30), focus group discussions (6 groups), and classroom observations (12 cases) to thoroughly investigate teachers' role adaptation processes in AI-assisted experimental teaching, the socio-psychological challenges they encounter, and the integration pathways of environmental sustainability practices. The findings reveal that Malaysian secondary physics teachers demonstrate significant stratified characteristics in their cognitive levels regarding AI technology, with 23.8% possessing high cognitive levels, and younger teachers showing markedly higher technology acceptance than their older counterparts. During the role adaptation process, 72.4% of teachers experience varying degrees of role identity conflicts, primarily manifested as challenges to professional authority (68.1%) and shifts in instructional control (74.3%). Technology anxiety and adaptation pressure exhibit high correlation (r=0.72), with significant gaps between social support needs and current provision, particularly in technical training support (gap of 1.65 points).Environmental awareness exerts decisive influence on instructional design, with teachers possessing high environmental awareness demonstrating superior performance (78.9%) in integrating sustainability elements compared to those with low environmental awareness (31.6%). Green experimental teaching practice models achieve remarkable effectiveness, with 73.6% of teachers adopting related models and realizing 42.8% resource conservation rates. The achievement of sustainable development education goals exhibits multi-pathway synergistic effects, with interdisciplinary integrated teaching yielding optimal results (4.15 points), and students maintaining environmental behavior continuity rates of 78.3% post-graduation.The study constructs a three-dimensional ""cognition-emotion-behavior"" role adaptation model and a ""technology-environment-society"" triangular integration framework, providing theoretical guidance and practical pathways for promoting the organic fusion of AI-assisted teaching and environmental sustainability practices.

However, teachers face many challenges including inequitable access to teaching resources in preschool environments. This not only affect teachers' job quality, willingness to teach, and career development, but may also indirectly affect children's physical and mental health, as well as educational outcomes. Educational approach emphasizing child-directed learning, hands-on activities, and a prepared environment including concepts like play as pedagogy has been shown in many studies to improve learner engagement. Such approaches form the basis of methodologies like the Montessori and the use of toys in pre-school education. The limitation of modern toys has led to the exploration of alternatives like Traditional Chinese toys (TCT) with their potential for ease of use, graphic cognition, and diverse play. Users’ acceptance, perceived usability, ease of use and intention to use technology has however been central to the introduction of technologies in various contexts, including education. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study explored preschool teachers' satisfaction and willingness to use TCT in teaching. A questionnaire was administered to 235 preschool teachers teaching with TCT. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicate that teachers' overall satisfaction and willingness to continue using the TCT are high. Perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) were the main factors influencing teachers' satisfaction and the main drivers of their willingness to continue using, with PEU having a stronger influence. Among the preschool teachers who were tested, the mean values of teachers from preschool major backgrounds were higher than those of teachers from non-preschool major backgrounds, reflecting the higher acceptance of TCT among teachers from preschool major backgrounds. Findings suggest that more easy-to-use and interesting teaching resources should be developed to reduce teachers' cognitive load, promote children's development, and facilitate sustainable education. Future research should focus on designing instructional adaptations of TCT in different cultural contexts and longitudinally tracking and evaluating their long-term effects on teachers' and preschooler's multidimensional development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cultural perception; preschool education; preschool teacher; TAM; Traditional Chinese toys",""

Facing substantial operational and financial pressures due to rising chronic disease management costs, MetroCare sought to enhance its traditional risk models, which relied solely on structured clinical data and often misclassified intermediate-risk patients. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, MetroCare integrated previously untapped social and behavioral determinants from clinicians’ unstructured electronic health record notes into a new predictive model. This AI-driven approach significantly improved accuracy (AUC increased from 0.834 to 0.860), reduced unnecessary clinical interventions by approximately 30%, and generated estimated annual cost savings of about $1.7 million per 1000 patients. The case highlights critical implementation considerations, including threshold tuning to balance intervention precision against potential missed risks, workflow integration challenges, clinician acceptance, and ethical issues surrounding patient privacy and fairness.

To ensure that MT grows well and is widely used, it is important to know how people from different cultures accept it. This study provides a complete description of how to use the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) to obtain expert agreement on the most important factors that influence how acceptable mobile tourism is from a cultural perspective. This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions to carefully find and confirm the variables and indicators and how they are interrelated. This approach describes a rigorous process with nine stages in reaching expert agreement. The results revealed that experts largely agreed on the variables related to perceived usefulness, perceived trust, perceived ease of use, and facilitating conditions in the TAM framework, as well as some variables of collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation in Hofstede's cultural aspects. This study also verified and validated the overall relationship between variables in building the Mobile Tourism Cultural Acceptance (MTCA) framework, the general and specific interactions between variables, and the function of cultural dimensions as mediators. This study shows how important it is to get expert opinion when making a comprehensive plan on how to use technology in a culturally acceptable environment for mobile tourism. The information obtained has a major impact on mobile tourism developers, policy makers, and marketers who want to make MT more popular. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural acceptance; Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM); hofstede's cultural dimensions; mobile tourism; technology acceptance model (TAM)","Cultural acceptance; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Mobile Technology; Mobile tourism; Short periods; Technology acceptance model; Tourism sectors; Technology transfer"

It addresses a significant gap in understanding the interplay between technology-driven customer experiences and brand relationships. By focusing on the dynamics of chatbot interaction, the research seeks to provide insights into fostering emotional connections and advocacy behaviors while managing AI skepticism in consumer-brand interactions. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a quantitative survey design to explore the impact of consumers’ interaction experiences with AI chatbots on brand attachment and advocacy. A structured online questionnaire gathered data from 388 participants, ensuring familiarity with chatbot usage. Structural equation modeling and Smart PLS 3.0 were utilized for confirmatory and structural analyses. Additionally, multi-group analysis was performed to assess the moderating role of consumer AI skepticism. Reliability and validity of the measurement scales were ensured through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings The study found that positive chatbot interaction experiences significantly enhance brand attachment and advocacy. Consumer AI skepticism negatively moderates these relationships, reducing the impact of chatbot interactions on brand advocacy but not on brand attachment. Brand attachment partially mediates the relationship between chatbot interaction experiences and advocacy, emphasizing emotional bonds’ role in driving advocacy. The findings highlight the importance of designing engaging and trustworthy chatbot experiences to cultivate strong consumer-brand relationships. Research limitations/implications The study’s reliance on convenience sampling may limit the generalizability of its findings. Further research should explore sector-specific applications, such as tourism or telecommunications, to validate the proposed model. Examining diverse age groups and using alternative theoretical frameworks, like the theory of planned behavior, could provide richer insights. Despite these limitations, the research offers a foundational understanding of the role of AI chatbots in consumer-brand relationships, guiding future studies on AI skepticism and its implications for technology-mediated interactions. Practical implications Business practitioners can leverage the study’s insights to enhance chatbot interactions by ensuring reliable, personalized and engaging experiences. Monitoring and addressing consumer AI skepticism is critical to maintaining trust and fostering brand advocacy. Chatbots should provide accurate and credible information to counteract AI skepticism effectively. Brands can improve loyalty by incorporating user-friendly designs and tailoring chatbot responses based on consumer data. These strategies can strengthen emotional connections, drive advocacy and support long-term consumer engagement. Social implications AI chatbots significantly influence consumer trust and brand advocacy, with implications for social behavior in digital interactions. By addressing AI skepticism, companies can foster a culture of transparency and reliability in AI-powered customer service. This promotes positive consumer perceptions of AI technology, encouraging broader acceptance and responsible use of AI-driven tools in society. Furthermore, enhancing consumer experiences with chatbots can support ethical AI deployment, minimizing misinformation and fostering inclusive digital environments. Originality/value This research is among the first to empirically examine the dual role of chatbot interaction experiences and consumer AI skepticism in shaping brand attachment and advocacy. By exploring these dynamics, it extends current literature on AI in marketing, emphasizing emotional and behavioral outcomes of AI-driven consumer interactions. The study provides actionable recommendations for businesses to optimize chatbot strategies, ensuring meaningful customer engagement and addressing the challenges posed by consumer AI skepticism. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI chatbots; AI skepticism; Brand advocacy; Brand attachment; Interaction experience",""

The present study examines the decisive factors that impact mathematics teachers’ integration of digital technologies within a one-to-one digital learning environment. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a guiding framework, our research intends to identify predictors that influence teachers’ continuance intentions (CI) to incorporate these technologies. The research employs a modified UTAUT model that includes, beyond its core constructs, additional factors identified as significant in previous studies: perceived pedagogical impact (PPI), social influence and student expectations (SSE), and anxiety (ANX). Survey data from 918 mathematics teachers were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicate that performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), and technology compatibility (TC) positively influence CI, while ANX has a negative effect. No significant gender differences were observed. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that the influence of the predictor variables on teachers’ CI is only marginally moderated by teachers’ experience. These results underscore the need for targeted professional development that enhances teachers’ confidence and digital competencies while addressing technology-related anxiety. To maximise the benefits of digital integration in mathematics education, institutional support should prioritise reducing barriers to technology use and fostering positive perceptions of its pedagogical impact. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mathematics teachers; One-to-one digital learning environment; Structural equation modelling; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology",""

Methods: This was a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study conducted among CHOs and tutors at the CHO training school of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). A survey assessed students’ acceptability of VBL using an adapted framework that integrated Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Technology Acceptance Model. Six key informant interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted among tutors and students respectively. Quantitative data was analysed descriptively with STATA version 15 while qualitative data was analyzed thematically using NVivo software version 14. Results: The total acceptance score for VBL from the survey was 83.3 %, ranging from 52.9 % in the computer anxiety construct to 82.9 % in the behavioural intention construct. Didactic lectures were mostly used to teach in the school. VBL was acceptable to the students and tutors because it helps recall, can be referred to later, and is convenient. Students and tutors said the provision of electricity, electronic gadgets (laptops, projectors, video players), good Wi-Fi, and alternative electric power sources would facilitate VBL. Common barriers to VBL were poor internet connectivity, cost of data, inadequate supply of electricity, and the need to have good devices. Conclusion: Ministries of Education and Ministries of Health need to integrate VBL into community health workers training due to its benefits in enhancing learning and memory. There should be adequate provision of electricity and stable internet connections to provide an enabling environment. Tutors should ensure engaging content of videos and develop relevant skills for VBL. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptability; Community health officers; Facilitators and barriers; Nigeria; Video-based learning",""

The study specifically explores how core components—including the virtual live-streaming environment, the characteristics of the virtual presenter (avatar), content quality, and real-time interactivity—influence students’ perceived usefulness and learning engagement. The theoretical basis for the investigation is grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework. Methodology: A quantitative methodology was adopted, with data gathered through an online questionnaire administered to 553 university students who had prior experience with learning via virtual live-streaming platforms. The dataset was subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS to examine the interrelationships among the study variables. Results: The analysis demonstrated statistically significant positive associations across all examined variables. Improvements in both the technological aspects of the virtual environment and the perceived social presence of the avatar were found to enhance students’ propensity for active participation in online learning. Furthermore, content quality and immediate interactivity emerged as primary contributors to sustained learner engagement and the promotion of deeper cognitive outcomes. Conclusion: The study concludes that refining the virtual learning environment, strengthening the features of the avatar, and ensuring high-quality content alongside real-time interactions significantly enhance perceived usefulness among learners, ultimately encouraging more active and effective participation in online education. Implications: In light of these outcomes, the study offers strategic recommendations for students, developers of virtual live-streaming platforms, and enterprises operating in the virtual reality (VR) sector to refine their approaches and contribute to enriched online educational experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Online Learning; College Students; SOR; TAM; Virtual Live-Streaming",""

Despite the proven benefits of nature exposure, modern indoor living often disconnects individuals from nature, particularly in windowless spaces. This disconnect has led to the development of biophilic design interventions aimed at integrating nature into built environments to enhance occupant well-being and connectedness to nature. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness and public acceptance of indoor biophilic design interventions, referred to as biophilic illusions, among 345 California-based participants through an online questionnaire. Specifically, we evaluated three modalities of biophilic illusions: wind-animated tree shadows, sun-animated lighting, and location-responsive sounds, using low-fidelity digital prototypes. The study’s two objectives were to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of biophilic design interventions in promoting nature connectedness and occupant well-being, and (2) understand the factors influencing public acceptance of these technological interventions using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model.

However, prior studies on determinants of university library smart services continued use willingness (CUW) predominantly examined isolated dimensions without proposing comprehensive models that integrate system level, individual user, and external environmental influence factors. This study aims to identify the determinants of users’ CUW for smart services in university libraries. It seeks to construct an integrated theoretical model that addresses gaps in prior frameworks by incorporating factors such as social influence, convenience conditions, personal characteristic, and perceived risk. An integrated model was developed by synthesizing constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Information Systems Success Model (D&M), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Employing stratified random sampling, we collected 309 valid questionnaires from university library users of China. Statistical analyses included reliability/validity tests, correlation analysis, and linear regression to examine relationships between variables. Information quality, system quality, service quality, personal characteristic, performance expectation, effort expectation, and convenience condition had a significant positive impact on user satisfaction. Conversely, perceived risk and social influence had no significant impact. For CUW, information quality, system quality, service quality, performance expectation, and convenience condition showed significant positive effects, while personal characteristic, effort expectation, perceived risk, and social influence were non-significant. Key challenges included deficiencies in information quality, system limitations, and service shortfalls. The validated framework emphasizes convenience condition, information quality, and system quality as primary drivers of university library users’ CUW. Recommendations include modernizing infrastructure, fostering collaborative resource ecosystems, and implementing AI-driven personalized services to enhance user retention. This study provides theoretical and practical insights for optimizing smart library services globally, though future research should expand cross-cultural comparisons, mixed research etc. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","continued use willingness; influence factors; smart services; university library; user behavior",""

The findings show that students’ acceptance of BL is influenced mainly by their behavioural intention to use BL, which plays a central role in determining behaviour of BL, far more than by self-efficacy or writing. performance. Additionally, among the core constructs of UTAUT2, performance expectancy and effort expectancy contribute largely to forming attitude to use BL, which mainly predicts behavioural intention to use BL, self-efficacy, and writing performance.

It further explores how DPTS, along with ease of use and perceived benefits, affects actual digital payment usage (DPU) and investigates how prior cybercrime experience (CE) moderates the relationship between DPTS and DPU. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 650 digital payment users across India’s western, eastern and central regions. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted using IBM SPSS and AMOS to test the proposed model. Multi-group analysis was employed to assess the moderating role of cybercrime experience by comparing users with and without prior exposure to cyber incidents. Findings – Perceived benefits, ease of use, grievance redressal and social influence significantly enhance users’ trust and cybersecurity perceptions, which in turn strongly predict digital payment systems adoption. Cybercrime experience significantly weakens the trust-usage link, indicating that digital trauma can override system strengths and suppress adoption behavior. Social implications – These findings highlight the broader socioeconomic implications of digital trust, particularly its role in advancing financial inclusion, economic participation and digital literacy in emerging economies. Originality/value – This research contributes theoretically by integrating cybercrime experience as a behavioral moderator in technology adoption models. It extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) frameworks by introducing a dynamic trust perspective shaped by prior adverse experiences. The study advances understanding of digital payment behavior in high-risk environments and offers practical insights for developing trust-centric, resilient financial technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Digital payments; Digitalization; India; SEM; Trust",""

This study examines the adoption of KaseChar, a mobile application designed to reduce open-field burning and promote agriwaste management among Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) farmers in Chachoengsao Province, Eastern Thailand. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we evaluated perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and behavioral intention (BI) through a structured survey of 150 farmers. Results show high ratings for PU (mean = 4.11), PEOU (mean = 4.08), and BI (mean = 4.03), with key adoption drivers including productivity, efficiency, digital proficiency, and social influence. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified efficiency, usability, and public support as core factors. Waste management cost significantly influenced PU (β = 0.126, p = 0.009), while internet usage was positively correlated with PEOU (β = 0.252, p = 0.002). Despite high smartphone access, barriers such as digital literacy, labor intensity, and infrastructure gaps—particularly among older farmers—limit adoption. The study recommends targeted training, subsidies, and digital infrastructure improvements to scale adoption. It also contributes to TAM literature by integrating contextual variables like digital readiness and financial capacity.

This study focuses on socio-political challenges, particularly in the context of recent developments in Europe, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This research is based on an extensive literature review, a stakeholders’ workshop, and an expert survey, leading to a thematic analysis that identifies major socio-political factors influencing CC(U)S deployment in Europe. Our analysis suggests a conceptual framework that addresses these challenges and identifies two core conceptual domains–socio-political context and background environment–as critical factors for the future development of CC(U)S. The findings indicate that political development and social acceptability are pivotal drivers of CC(U)S deployment. Political development is increasingly linking energy security to national security, prompting a shift towards leveraging domestic resources. Social acceptability beyond social acceptance has the potential to become the focus of future discourses. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of trust- a factor that is prevalently discussed in the literature- in policymakers and industry in post-trust societies affected by major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion. Finally, we propose a preliminary evaluation model to assess the socio-political readiness of European countries for CC(U)S deployment.

Methods: Following the design thinking approach, we conducted three qualitative studies. In the first study, we examined the needs of and opportunities for using TPRs in education as well as some of the related challenges. This was based on the personal experiences of six academic staff members in two Estonian higher education institutions. Building on the first study, we designed a 13-week synchronous hybrid undergraduate-level course using TPRs. The course was delivered to six students. Based on the students’ homework and written feedback, the first prototype of a pedagogical design model was subsequently developed. In the third study, this model was piloted with 56 teachers by means of a two-hour hands-on synchronous hybrid workshop. Results: Based on the teachers’ feedback, the prototype was further improved and the PEPCII Pedagogical Design Model was completed. The PEPCII model comprises six central components that address key barriers to the adoption of TPR-s in education: Physical Operational and Educational Environment, Ethical and Cybersecurity Considerations, Cognitive and Physical Limitations, Pedagogical Integration, Inclusive Access and Engagement, and Instructional Methods. Discussion: The PEPCII model addresses critical barriers to TPR adoption in education. Future research is required to validate the model in varied classroom settings over longer durations, and to assess impacts on engagement and well-being of TPR users, on-site students, and instructors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","pedagogical design model; social presence; synchronous hybrid learning; technology acceptance; telepresence robot",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming education through adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring, and personalized instruction. Although AI has become increasingly prominent in language education, its specific impact on enhancing Arabic proficiency has not been adequately explored, especially in terms of student engagement, linguistic development, and sustained adoption. This study examines the behavioral factors influencing the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in Arabic language learning by applying the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) framework. Materials/methods. To achieve this, quantitative data were collected from students at Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, including both Arabic majors and students from other disciplines. This study utilizes ordinal logistic regression to examine the key factors influencing students' adoption of AI in Arabic language learning. It explores how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, hedonic motivation, and habit shape students’ engagement with AI-driven tools. Results. Findings indicate that performance expectancy and social influence are the strongest drivers of adoption, while effort expectancy and facilitating conditions play a key role in sustained engagement. Despite AI’s potential to enhance pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary acquisition, adoption remains inconsistent due to usability issues, content accuracy concerns, and varying levels of AI literacy. Conclusion. The study highlights the need for structured AI integration, improved digital literacy, and interactive AI-driven learning environments to enhance Arabic language acquisition in higher education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-assisted language learning; Arabic proficiency; ordinal logistic regression; UTAUT2",""

While prior research has extensively examined initial adoption, little attention has been given to understanding the continuous intention of preschool teachers with AIGC. To bridge this gap, this study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), and Flow Theory to develop a comprehensive framework that captures cognitive, affective, and experiential factors shaping continued AIGC adoption. Background AIGC has demonstrated immense educational potential, providing personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and intelligent student progress tracking. However, most existing research focuses primarily on system usability and feasibility, neglecting the motivational and psychological aspects that determine continuous intention to use AIGC. Specifically, satisfaction, expectation confirmation, and flow experience have been largely overlooked as key determinants of sustained technology use. Given that preschool educators face unique pedagogical challenges, such as adapting AIGC content to young learners and maintaining engagement, understanding the drivers of long-term AIGC use is essential for optimizing its integration into preschool education. Methodology This study employs a mixed-method approach to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive analysis. A total of 433 preschool teachers participated in the survey, and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypothesized relationships. To complement structural modeling, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling was applied to uncover non-linear relationships that traditional statistical methods might overlook. By integrating PLS-SEM and ANN, this study provides a more robust, predictive, and holistic understanding of the factors driving sustained AIGC adoption. Contribution This study makes significant theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, it extends TAM and ECM by incorporating Flow Theory. Unlike prior studies focusing primarily on perceived usefulness and ease of use, this research identifies confirmation and satisfaction as the strongest predictors of continued intention to use AIGC. Practically, the findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, school administrators, and ed-tech developers, offering recommendations for designing more engaging, sustainable, and user-friendly AIGC solutions tailored for preschool education. Findings The results indicate that satisfaction (β = 0.280, p < 0.001) is the strongest predictor of continued AIGC use, followed by attitude (β = 0.262, p < 0.001) and flow experience (β = 0.223, p < 0.001). Expectation confirmation significantly enhances perceived usefulness (β = 0.505, p < 0.001) and satisfaction (β = 0.349, p < 0.001), reinforcing the importance of aligning AIGC tools with teachers’ expectations. ANN analysis further highlights confirmation (95.28%) and satisfaction (82.41%) as the most influential factors, whereas perceived ease of use (22.35%) has a relatively minor impact. These findings suggest that positive user experience, engagement, and expectation fulfillment are key drivers of long-term AIGC adoption. Moreover, ANN analysis revealed complex nonlinear relationships, demonstrating that traditional statistical methods might underestimate the true impact of psychological and experiential factors on technology retention. Recommendations For practitioners, this study provides several actionable recommendations. First, for Practitioners AIGC tools should be designed to enhance engagement and intrinsic motivation, integrating gamification elements, interactive features, and adaptive learning support to sustain user interest. Second, ongoing professional development programs should be implemented to train teachers on the pedagogical applications of AIGC, addressing any concerns related to usability or long-term feasibility. Third, AIGC platforms should incorporate customization features, allowing educators to tailor content based on their specific classroom needs and teaching styles. By addressing these factors, AIGC adoption in preschool education can be more sustainable and impactful. Recommendations For researchers, this study opens multiple avenues for future exploration. First, for Researchers future research should adopt a longitudinal approach to examine how preschool teachers’ attitudes and behaviors toward AIGC evolve over time. Second, more research is needed to explore the role of teacher personality traits and digital literacy levels in shaping AIGC adoption patterns. Third, cross-cultural studies could provide deeper insights into how different educational systems and sociocultural contexts influence preschool teachers’ responses to AIGC technologies. Furthermore, AI-driven predictive analytics should be explored to model behavioral trends and optimize AIGC implementations across diverse learning environments. Impact on Society This study has significant implications for educational equity, teacher workload, and early childhood learning experiences. By empowering preschool teachers with AIGC, this research promotes more inclusive and accessible preschool education, reducing disparities in educational resources and opportunities. Additionally, AI-driven teaching solutions can alleviate teacher workload, enabling educators to focus on creative and interactive pedagogical strategies rather than administrative tasks. As AIGC continues to evolve, its potential to transform preschool education into a more engaging, adaptive, and learner-centered experience becomes increasingly evident. Future Research While this study provides valuable insights into preschool teachers’ sustained use of AIGC, several areas require further exploration. First, objective usage data should be incorporated into future research rather than relying solely on self-reported surveys to enhance validity. Second, longitudinal studies should examine how teachers’ continuous intention to use AIGC evolves over time in response to technological advancements and policy shifts. Third, as this study focuses on preschool educators, future research should explore whether the identified factors apply to primary and secondary education teachers. Additionally, ethical concerns, AI trust, and data privacy issues should be further investigated, as they may significantly impact the long-term adoption of AIGC in educational settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-generated content (AIGC); artificial neural networks (ANN); preschool education; structural equation modeling (SEM)",""

As a new productivity tool, AIGC tool adoption by design students is influenced by various factors. However, there is a lack of systematic research on this topic in the academic community, which hinders the sustainable development of AIGC tools. Based on this, the study combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Task-Technology Fit (TTF) models to construct a dual-perspective model—integrating “technology (external)” and “individual (internal)” dimensions—to investigate the key factors influencing design students’ willingness to adopt AIGC tools in their professional learning. A questionnaire was distributed to Chinese design students, resulting in 517 valid responses. The structural equation model (SEM) analysis yielded the following findings: Characteristics of AIGC Technology (CoAT) and students’ task characteristics positively influence task-technology fit. CoAT positively affect performance expectations (PE) but have no significant impact on effort expectations (EE). Task-technology fit positively influences use behaviors and performance expectations. Additionally, performance expectations, effort expectations, and social influences (SI) significantly enhance willingness to use, which in turn drives use behaviors (UB). Conversely, facilitating conditions (FC) do not affect use behaviors. Based on the empirical findings, this study discusses strategies for enhancing design students’ adoption of AIGC tools and provides recommendations for promoting their adoption and sustainability in design education.eing rejected by search engines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; educational technology; generative models; human computer interaction; user interfaces","Artificial intelligence; Design; Engineering education; Students; Sustainable development; Academic community; Critical factors; Integrating technology; Performance expectations; Perspective models; Productivity tools; Systematic research; Task technology fit; Task-technology fit models; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Tools"

By utilizing a three-stage analysis of Structural Equation Modeling, Artificial Neural Network and Necessary Condition Analysis (SEM-ANN-NCA), the results identify that the consumers (n = 758) corresponding to this cohort are led significantly by hedonic motivation and social influence. The results show that all four basic variables of the UTAUT model had a significant effect on adoption intention. The hedonic motivation variable, taken from UTAUT2 theory, was also found to be significantly influencing the adoption intention. Additionally, the study result demonstrated that perceived anthropomorphism negatively moderates the relationship of adoption intention and actual usage. Based on the necessary condition analysis, it was observed that only the two variables, facilitating conditions and social influence, were found to be mandatory conditions, while the others were sufficient conditions. Interestingly, perceived trust and perceived risk were neither necessary nor sufficient conditions. The study provides enriching insights for human-computer literature and various stakeholders.

Despite the widely acknowledged potential of 3D printing to transform construction practices by lowering costs, increasing efficiency and enhancing sustainability, adoption has been slow. The research focuses on the economic, social, environmental and regulatory factors. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review discusses both the benefits – such as lower labour costs, faster construction times and less material waste – and the drawbacks – such as high initial costs, reliance on traditional methods and a lack of standardized regulations. A quantitative research methodology was used to investigate these issues, which included distributing a structured survey to 150 construction industry professionals. The survey’s purpose was to collect detailed quantitative data on 3D printing perceptions, preferences and experiences. The data were analysed with SPSS software using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and reliability testing, which provided a thorough understanding of the factors influencing 3D printing adoption. Findings: The study concludes with actionable recommendations to address these challenges, such as advocating for increased government support through subsidies and incentives, investing in training and education to reduce resistance to change and developing standardized regulations to ensure the safe and effective implementation of 3D printing. These strategies, which are consistent with the literature, are required for the construction industry to fully realize the benefits of 3D printing technology, ultimately increasing productivity, lowering costs and contributing to more sustainable construction practices. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations. The sample size was modest and geographically limited, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader construction contexts. Additionally, some survey constructs demonstrated low internal reliability, suggesting the need for more refined measurement tools in future studies. The cross-sectional design also limits the ability to assess changes in perceptions over time. Despite these limitations, the study provides important insights into the economic, social, environmental and regulatory barriers to 3D printing adoption. The findings offer practical implications for industry stakeholders, policymakers and researchers seeking to advance innovation within the construction sector. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide actionable insights for construction industry stakeholders seeking to adopt 3D printing technologies. Addressing economic challenges through financial incentives, training and partnerships can enhance feasibility, particularly for SMEs. Environmental benefits such as material efficiency and reduced waste should be leveraged to support sustainable practices. Policymakers must develop clear regulatory frameworks to streamline approvals and ensure safety. Training programmes and awareness campaigns are essential to overcome social resistance and skill gaps. By addressing these areas, industry professionals and decision-makers can accelerate the responsible integration of 3D printing and drive innovation in construction processes. Social implications: The adoption of 3D printing in construction carries significant social implications, particularly in workforce transformation and public acceptance. While the technology may reduce demand for manual labour, it creates opportunities for skilled jobs in digital design, robotics and machinery operation. This shift highlights the urgent need for reskilling and upskilling programmes. Additionally, public perception plays a crucial role; concerns about safety, reliability and job displacement can hinder adoption. Raising awareness through education and demonstration projects can build trust and acceptance. Promoting inclusive access to training and employment in 3D printing can also support social equity and technological inclusion. Originality/value: This research reveals that 3D printing in the construction industry has numerous advantages and a few evident issues that have to be resolved to let construction use this effective type of technology more often. What is needed is a more consolidated, coordinated and systematic approach through the formation of strategic alliances, the development of complete legal codes and the promotion of lessons with construction ideas and information. Such an approach will additionally help to eliminate current barriers and guarantee that the construction industry will be ready to meet future requirements and challenges effectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D printing in construction; Additive manufacturing; Construction industry innovation; Digital fabrication; Industry 4.0; Productivity in construction","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Energy policy; Investments; Personnel training; 3-D printing; 3d printing in construction; 3D-printing; Construction industry innovation; Digital fabrication; Economic barriers; Industry innovations; Printing technologies; Productivity in construction; Regulatory barriers; Construction industry"

As the issue of anxiety and stress within the educational system (both among teachers and students) is becoming increasingly relevant and widely studied due to its deep consequences for overall mental and physical health, the article explores some of the main sources of stress and anxiety among students, with an emphasis on integrating innovative methods and techniques into pedagogical practice, such as robotics. Тhe research presented in this article involves 106 participants, 51 of whom are primary school teachers and 55 are students from pedagogical specialties. 86 of the participants are women and 20 are men. An interesting trend is the higher degree of acceptance of robotic applications among future teachers compared to practicing teachers. A similar difference is observed in attitudes regarding the impact of robotic applications on students' cognitive development. Future teachers are more likely to agree with the benefits of robotic applications on students' cognitive development. A larger percentage of future teachers believe that they will make mathematics more attractive, while only 17.6% of practicing teachers share this view. Future teachers demonstrate a higher degree of acceptance and optimism toward innovative technologies. Practicing teachers show more reservation, distrust, and uncertainty. Researching attitudes towards robotic applications in primary school mathematics education could contribute to expanding the understanding of the importance of this approach, which influences not only future academic achievements but also the overall psycho-social development of the individual. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anxiety; coping strategies; educational process; innovative approaches; primary school age; psychological characteristics; robotic applications; school environment; stress",""

As these advanced tools become increasingly prevalent in classrooms, understanding the factors that influence pre-service teachers' acceptance and adoption of such technologies has become critically important for effective educational policies and practices. This study aims to extend the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine the factors influencing pre-service teachers' adoption of generative AI tools. The research is based on data collected from 748 pre-service teachers from 12 universities in Turkey. The model includes the core constructs of TAM as well as exogenous variables such as Metacognitive Self-regulation (MSR), Subjective Norm (SN), Learning Motivation (LM) and Learning Agility (LA). The results of Structural Equation Modeling showed that the model explained 54% of the variance in Attitude and 51% of the variance in Behavioral Intention. MSR and LM had significant effects on Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use, while LA and SN were found to be effective only on Perceived Ease of Use. These findings highlight that intrinsic cognitive and motivational factors are more influential than external social factors in determining how pre-service teachers evaluate the usefulness of generative AI tools. Additionally, our study reveals that learning agility significantly contributes to perceived ease of use, suggesting that adaptability is a key factor in technological adoption among educators. These results suggest that training programs for generative AI in teacher education should prioritize hands-on activities that strengthen self-regulation skills and intrinsic motivation, rather than focusing solely on technical features. Curriculum designers and teacher educators should create learning environments that nurture adaptability and metacognitive skills to facilitate successful integration of AI technologies in future educational practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agility; Generative artificial ıntelligence; Learning motivation; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model",""

The technology presents various advantages, as it can be utilized for heating, generating power, and functioning as both a fuel and a raw material in the chemical manufacturing process. However, its widespread adoption remains hindered by complex social, economic, and environmental challenges. Local acceptance is increasingly becoming a critical factor for biogas projects and the transition to renewable energy. The objective of this systematic review is to explore and assess the diverse factors that contribute to the acceptance of biogas, utilizing publications from the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for analysis. The study examined the connections among authors, disciplines, and geographic regions to contextualize the findings within the global framework. A visualization of similarities and Java-based software was utilized to map the trends in co-authorship, keyword co-occurrence, and thematic developments from 2013 to 2024. Adopting the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methodology, 1,358 studies were screened, resulting in 20 peer-reviewed publications meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 248 factors influencing the acceptance of biogas were identified and clustered along the three sustainability dimensions. Biogas projects are influenced by social, environmental, and economic factors in distinct ways depending on the country or region. The weight scores within each dimension were normalized and the overall score of the studies were calculated, allowing for a comparability of the studies. The finding reveals that social factors are the most significant determinants of biogas adoption, including public trust, procedural justice, and community involvement, accounting for 45 percent of the total. Financial aspects, including incentives, operational costs, and market conditions represent 31 percent. The remaining 24 percent was comprised of environmental factors that received the lowest overall scores, including emission reduction, resource compatibility, and land use impacts. This indicates that the environmental drivers are less emphasized than the other two dimensions. The study emphasizes the critical significance of local governance, the engagement of stakeholders, and the implementation of strategic communication in facilitating the uptake of biogas. Perceived benefits, equity in decision-making, and accessible financial mechanisms emerged as key enablers, while barriers included mistrust, lack of awareness, uneven decision-making, and cost constraints. The significance of tailoring strategies to local conditions is highlighted by regional disparities.

Using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the research integrates age and past use as antecedents of TA and evaluates their influence on perceived ease of use (PEoU), perceived enjoyment (PENJ), and user attitudes. Data from 206 participants were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) following a VR pilgrimage experience. The findings challenge conventional assumptions, revealing that past VR use increased TA, contradicting prior studies that associate familiarity with reduced anxiety. Additionally, older users exhibited lower TA levels than younger participants, highlighting a potential shift in how age influences technology adoption. TA significantly enhanced PENJ, indicating that anxiety may amplify emotional engagement in immersive settings, rather than solely acting as a barrier. While TA enhanced PEoU, it had a negative correlation with cybersickness, suggesting that anxious users might interact with VR more cautiously, thereby limiting sensory mismatches. Moreover, cybersickness did not significantly influence attitudes toward the system, emphasizing the dominance of engagement over physical discomfort in emotionally significant experiences. Attitude toward the system strongly predicted use intention, highlighting the necessity of designing VR experiences that balance usability with emotional engagement. This study provides new insights into the psychological and demographic factors influencing VR adoption and offers practical strategies for optimizing user experience, particularly in religious and cultural applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age and technology use; cybersickness impact; technology anxiety; virtual reality adoption","Age and technology use; Cybersickness; Cybersickness impact; Emotional engagements; Perceived ease-of-use; Perceived enjoyment; Role of technologies; Technology anxiety; Technology use; Virtual reality adoption; Virtual environments"

For this purpose, the components of UTAUT2 have been used to explain behavioral intentions, along with gamification being considered as the moderating variable. Data was collected from 510 investors to whom the questionnaire was sent, belonging to the National Capital Region of India, having experience of using these online platforms for their investment needs. Structural equation modelling and path analysis have been applied to conduct the desired analysis. The findings reveal that factors like performance and effort expectancy can help understand the intentions of users to adopt the online investment platforms. The study thus found that AI-based gamified online investment platforms have a multidimensional approach to user engagement. Each of these dimensions represents a critical aspect of users’ perception and their interaction with the system. For developers and marketers of AI powered gamified investment platforms, the practical implications of this study are meaningful. The findings indicate that increasing user engagement will require improvement in performance expectancy through enhancing easy-to-use design as well as improving investment outcomes (effort expectancy). Besides enhancing social influence capitalized on by social features, availability should be ensured so as to support facilitating conditions. As indicated by the extensive literature reviewed, not much attention has been paid to digitization of investment platforms and their adoption. Also, very few studies have been carried out to understand how integration of AI backed gamification has helped increasing acceptance of these service providers. Hence, the present work is one of the pioneering studies, where UTAUT2 has been applied to understand the users’ intention for online investment platforms adoption. Also, the study has made attempts to understand the role of gamifying features in this scenario. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; behavioral intention; Gamification; millennials; online investment; UTAUT","Behavioral intention; Financial environments; Gamification; Millennials; National capital regions; Online investments; Performance; User engagement; UTAUT; ]+ catalyst"

The psychological effects of trauma, especially in aging populations, can complicate mental and physical health, highlighting the need for tailored technological solutions. Methods: The research involved two focus groups with Holocaust survivors (N = 12) who engaged directly with a social robot. Discussions explored their needs, barriers, and coping strategies based on their longitudinal experiences of trauma, resilience, and aging. Transcripts were thematically analyzed, identifying key TIC-related themes—safety, trust, self-compassion, and self-efficacy—in relation to engagement with companion robots. Results: Findings revealed that trauma survivors face significant challenges in communication and technology use. Safe and trusting environments were fundamental for meaningful engagement with robots. Self-compassion and self-efficacy emerged as essential to overcoming initial barriers, indicating that TIC-informed design features could facilitate better uptake and acceptance. Discussion: The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating TIC principles to ensure these robots meet the complex needs of trauma survivors. Findings also underscore the personal histories, ongoing changes in recollecting the trauma, and the need for stable, empathetic interactions highlights the complexity of designing assistive robots for profoundly affected populations. This study contributes to digital mental health and aging technologies by emphasizing stability, empathy, and user-centered design in developing assistive robotics as a universal, scalable solution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","companion robot; elderly trauma survivors; human-robot interaction; humanoid robot; observation study; PTSD; trauma-informed care",""

In this paper, we study the influence mechanism of multiple external factors on readers’ willingness to deeply participate in library smart reading promotion from the perspectives of technology, organization and environment, based on the TAM, SIPS model and TOE framework. Design/methodology/approach: First, based on the review of relevant literature, this paper seeks the theoretical basis of the research with the guidance of the technology acceptance model, TOE framework and SIPS model. Then the grounded theory is used to dig out the five main categories of technical factors, environmental factors, organizational factors, readers’ perception and willingness to participate deeply, explore the constituent factors of the main categories and the mechanism of action between them, and we construct a model of factors affecting the readers’ willingness to participate deeply in the promotion of smart reading in libraries. In the quantitative research part, 466 valid questionnaires were collected and the structural equation model is used to verify the relationship between variables. Findings: The study finds that: (1) in the process of readers’ deep participation in library smart reading promotion, technological factors (personalization, interactivity and integration), organizational factors (information quality and service quality) and environmental factors (interactive atmosphere) positively affect readers’ perceptions of smart reading promotion, with interactivity and interactive atmosphere having a more significant effect; (2) the degree of confirmation of expectations has a significant positive effect on readers’ perceived usefulness (3) Readers’ willingness to participate in depth includes three aspects: willingness to read, willingness to interact and willingness to share and readers’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use can significantly affect willingness to participate in depth. Research limitations/implications: (1) In terms of research methodology, the questionnaire was distributed in a rather basic form, and there are limitations in the screening of the survey sample and the breadth of sample coverage. In order to understand the relationship between variables more comprehensively, future research could consider using longitudinal data and conducting longer-term observation and research on the same group of subjects to further validate the conclusions of this paper. (2) In terms of the survey subjects, this paper was selected as a group of library readers who have carried out smart reading promotion. Meanwhile, most of the respondents are young readers with higher education, and the sample range is limited. Practical implications: This paper explores the various factors that affect users’ deep participation in smart reading promotion and provides theoretical and practical guidance for the library’s smart reading promotion work. Its research results help libraries improve the effectiveness of smart reading promotion activities from multiple aspects, such as technology, organization and environment, so as to create a better reading environment for all users. Social implications: This paper’s discussion on readers’ willingness to participate deeply has great theoretical significance and practical value, which will help improve the overall quality of the nation, enhance the level of smart library services and promote the development of national reading. Originality/value: This paper divides readers’ willingness to participate deeply in reading promotion into three variables: willingness to read, willingness to interact and willingness to share, expanding the connotation and extension of readers’ willingness to participate deeply in reading promotion. Secondly, based on the SIPS model and TOE framework, a model of influencing factors of readers’ willingness to participate deeply in library smart reading promotion is proposed, and the structural equation model method is used to test the hypothesis, verifying the feasibility of the model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Influencing factors; Library; Smart reading promotion; Willingness to participate deeply",""

In this context, the study of human behavior and attitudes towards human–robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for understanding the acceptance of this emerging technology, which, in turn, can drive the development of more well-designed industrial robotic systems. This paper is aimed at translating, adapting, and validating a scale designed to measure acceptance in the context of HRI within industrial settings, with a focus on collaborative robots (cobots). To conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), 140 participants (male = 45%, female = 52%, and nonbinary = 3%) were recruited. The results revealed a four-factor structure for the Frankenstein Syndrome Questionnaire–Industrial Context (FSQ-IC): “general anxiety towards cobots” (α = 0.87), “trustworthiness towards developers of cobots” (α = 0.83), “apprehension towards cobots in the industrial context” (α = 0.73), and “expectation of cobots in social change” (α = 0.69). For further validation and to help ensure the validity and reliability of the adapted scale, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with a sample of 210 participants (male = 45%, female = 53%, and nonbinary = 2%).

Convergent and discriminant validities were also analyzed. An analysis of the differences in perceptions of acceptance based on sociodemographic variables (gender, experience with robots, educational level, and age) was conducted. Only gender revealed significant differences. Considering the psychometric qualities of the instrument, the FSQ-IC is valid and reliable for assessing acceptance in HRI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","collaborative robots; factor analysis; Frankenstein Syndrome Questionnaire (FSQ); psychometric evaluation",""

However, the adoption rate of PV technology remains limited in Jordan. The effective shift to solar energy necessitates social acceptance. Therefore, this study examines the public perception and degree of acceptance of PV in residential units. A survey that explored the relevant factors in terms of knowledge, concern, familiarity, satisfaction, attitude, and willingness was conducted. Four hundred and twenty responses were returned. The statistical analysis using SPSS included Cronbach's alpha test, normality testing, and correlation analysis. The analysis shows that average acceptance levels exist for the PV experience. Only 53.5% were familiar with PV. More people (56.4%) claimed to know about PV, and 62.2% were interested. Under half of the respondents were satisfied with PV. Most people had heard of PV, although only 32.6% considered their knowledge excellent. Observations of PV were communal. However, only 25% installed PV systems in their residences. Performance was the top PV priority, followed by environment, prices, and aesthetics. Solar panel installation intentions were highest on rooftops and lowest on BIPV. Also, it was found that socioeconomic and demographic profiles affect residents’ PV adoption. These variables can also moderate the relationship between relevant factors and PV perception. The study contributes to understanding the public's preference for PV applications. This perspective enhances PV awareness and adoption in residential units. This study highlights insights for architects, decision-makers, and governmental authorities on the requirements to support PV applications on the policy front. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","clean energy; green technology; public acceptance; residential buildings; SDGs; social perception; Solar photovoltaic (PV) innovation","Behavioral research; Decision making; Housing; Solar concentrators; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Clean energy; Green technology; Photovoltaic applications; Photovoltaics; Public acceptance; Residential building; SDG; Social perception; Solar photovoltaic innovation; Solar photovoltaics; Solar energy"

Non-Playable Characters (NPCs), integral to many video games, are computer-generated characters controlled by game algorithms rather than players. Despite their prominence in gaming, research on NPCs’ impact on learners’ perceptions, experiences, and acceptance of DGBL environments remains scarce. This study presents a framework that investigates the impact of non-player characters’ (NPCs) attributes, including social presence, telepresence, social support, and storytelling, on factors related to technology acceptance, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on the flow state and the intention to continue using a digital game-based learning (DGBL) environment. An experiment was conducted where learners were administered a survey after interacting with NPCs, simulating peers, professors, or industry experts teaching Fintech topics within a DGBL environment. Analysis of 200 valid responses using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling revealed that NPCs’ attributes significantly enhance perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and flow state in the DGBL environment. Furthermore, the findings indicate that perceived ease of use and the flow state positively affect learners’ intentions to continue using the DGBL environment. Thematic analysis per participant feedback highlighted the value of DGBL as an innovative educational approach that makes learning about Fintech accessible and engaging.

In response to these concerns, the “green banking” concept has emerged as a proactive approach to mitigating banks’ environmental impact. However, there is still limited research on adopting green banking from customers’ perspectives in developing countries, notably Pakistan. Therefore, this research is aimed at exploring and examining the factors influencing customers’ intention to adopt green banking and their usage behavior by employing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The UTAUT model was integrated with customers’ environmental responsibility and environmental concerns to identify the primary drivers of green banking proliferation. The research was carried out in Lahore, Pakistan, and involved 280 customers from private banks, and a convenience sampling technique was employed to gather data. The empirical findings have revealed that facilitating conditions and performance expectancy are the primary drivers of green banking proliferation, followed by environmental responsibility and environmental concerns. The study has discovered that behavioral intention plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, environmental responsibility, environmental concerns, and green banking usage behavior. The banking professionals should consider these factors when formulating and advancing green banking products or services and strategies to encourage the widespread adoption of green banking in conventional markets, fostering hope for a more sustainable future. The study provides new insights into customers’ inclination to adopt green banking and their subsequent usage behavior. This research will help to shape future studies in this particular field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavioral intention; environmental concerns; environmental responsibility; green banking; usage behavior; UTAUT model",""

As CVD risks can develop early in life, a life course approach for non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention is needed. Due to its potentially acceptable delivery mode, digital health education could be a promising way forward to increase adolescents’ CVD knowledge. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore adolescents’ CVD perceptions and their perceptions and preparedness for digital cardiovascular health education through mobile games. Methods: Twelve focus group discussions were conducted with adolescents, Grades 8–10, from two public and four private Nepalese schools. A qualitative study with a deductive thematic analysis was performed, guided by the health belief model (HBM) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Results: The analysis resulted in 6 themes and 13 sub-themes concerning perceptions of CVD and 5 themes and 10 sub-themes on perceptions and preparedness for digital cardiovascular health education through mobile games. The adolescents viewed CVD as a serious disease with consequences. A healthy diet and physical activity were important for prevention. Benefits were the positive impacts of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Barriers were the temptation of consuming unhealthy food, lack of healthy food environments, time and motivation. The adolescents also stressed their own ability to prevent CVD. Digital cardiovascular health education through mobile games was desirable. Constraints were accessibility and technical issues, parental allowance, available time and whether the game was engrossing enough. Conclusion: The adolescents perceived CVD as serious, with benefits and barriers connected to its prevention. Digital cardiovascular health education through mobile games was viewed positively but not without constraints for successful implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescents; cardiovascular disease; Digital health education; LMIC; mobile games; qualitative",""

From this, nutrient CE framework is not as simplistic as it looks, given the multitude of impingers that need to be considered. The lack of technological readiness and vast selection methodologies for some nutrient recovery technologies, low private-sector investment, divisive consumer perceptions, unique economic situations, localised regulatory specifications, threats of inefficient technology lock-ins, poor acceptance among farmers and WWTP operators due to infrastructural incompatibilities, lack of efficient CE supply chains, legacy infrastructure, poor digitised solutions for nutrient CE management, low training and awareness, and integration of nutrient CE WWTPs with broader society are barriers. On the contrary, nutrient CE WWTP will mainly be driven by regulations, subsidies and consumer-WWTP-farmer nutrient CE acceptances. This framework aims to tie in and provide solutions to overcoming barriers to nutrient CE WWTPs that is universally applicable. Consequently, the framework provides a holistic structure for policy, legislative, academic, agricultural, plant operators, commercial and consumer stakeholders a roadmap for the success and difficulties of nutrient CE WWTP adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular economy; Framework; Nutrients; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment plants","Eutrophication; Wastewater treatment; Circular economy; Consumer perception; Framework; Micro-macro; Nutrient recovery; Plant operators; Private-sector investments; Recovery technology; Resource recovery; Waste water treatment plants; environmental economics; eutrophication; nutrient; phosphorus; wastewater treatment plant"

Intercropping grain crops (GC) and cash crops (CC) increases landscape fragmentation, making pollution control harder. As producers of ANPS pollution and beneficiaries of its governance, farmers’ participation is crucial for improving water environments. However, the impact of social networks, closely related to farmers’ economic behavior in rural China, on different cropping types of farmers’ ANPS pollution governance behavior remains unclear. Based on survey data from 305 farmers in a typical village in the Lijiang River Basin, social networks of GC and CC farmers were constructed. By introducing network embedding theory, we examined how social networks influence governance resource allocation and collective action among farmers. Combining social network theory with technology acceptance model (TAM), an extended TAM was proposed to discuss the influence of farmers’ social network structural position (SNSP) on their willingness to participate in governance (WP), considering the role of cognition. Results showed that GC farmers’ social network have small-world characteristics (Small-world quotient=2.153) with a network density of only 0.016, lacking bridging ties and showing low trust among actors. CC farmers’ network had a density of 0.029, a clearer core-periphery structure (Core-periphery index=0.267), key farmers showed stronger bridging capabilities with average betweenness centrality of 4.234 %. CC farmers’ networks had diverse ties and higher trust among actors. CC farmers’ network structure improved information diffusion and is more effective in acquiring resources and collaborative governance. Structural equation modeling showed that SNSP positively affect WP for GC and CC farmers, with path coefficients of 0.245 and 0.294. Mediating analysis showed that GC farmers’ perceived usefulness and CC farmers’ perceived ease of use had the largest mediating effects between SNSP and WP, at 20.9 % and 26.8 %, highlighting cognition's different roles. Social networks variably impact governance behavior among different farmers, and strategies considering these differences can enhance governance efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative governance; Mediating effects; Resource allocation; Social network analysis; Technology acceptance model; Willingness","Agricultural non-point source pollutions; Cash crops; Collaborative governances; Grain crops; Mediating effect; Resources allocation; River basins; Social Network Analysis; Technology acceptance model; Willingness; River pollution; agricultural economics; agricultural land; cropping practice; farmers knowledge; governance approach; intercropping; nonpoint source pollution; pollution control; resource allocation; social network; technology adoption; willingness to pay; Li River"

This study examines the role of MDFs in determining households' intention to embrace SPTs within an integrated ecological perception framework, which focuses on the ecological advantages of SPTs, openness to innovation, and advantages to the built environment. We used the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling to analyze the Likert-scale data gathered from 311 respondents to reveal that the fixed cost of SPTs discourages households from embracing them. The advantages to the built environment, openness to innovation, and ecological advantages encourage households to accept SPTs, but only in urban districts and the entire dataset while portraying a neutral role in rural districts. Thus, urban and rural districts differ in impacting households’ adoption of SPTs. The social disposition of SPTs is the key driving force, while the advantages to the built environment play a less critical role. This study suggests propagating awareness among rural households about ecologically friendly dimensions of SPTs to uplift rural energy access, cultivating universal access to affordable and clean energy (SDG-7) and combating climatic disruptions (SDG-13). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advantages to the built environment; Integrated ecological perception framework; Openness to innovation; Solar power technology; Structural equation model; Sustainable energy transition","Advantage to the build environment; Clean energy; Energy transitions; Integrated ecological perception framework; Openness to innovation; Solar power technologies; Structural equation models; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy transition; Sustainable development goals; data set; perception; rural energy; solar power; technology adoption; uplift"

Can these avenues be put together, or are they parallel and, hence, not compatible? The answer to that question largely depends on the potential effects of digitalization on SFSCs. Going digital is a transformative process, accompanied by desirable and undesirable economic, social, environmental, and cultural impacts on short supply schemes. In this cross-sectional quantitative study, based on data from 211 individuals who frequently buy from SFSCs, we examined how consumers evaluate these impacts. We also investigated how participants’ perceptions of these impacts influence their acceptance of agricultural digitalization and their willingness to buy food products from digitalized SFSCs. Our results revealed that consumers view digitalization as a source of positive environmental but adverse social, cultural, and economic impacts on short supply schemes. In addition, we found that acceptance of digitalization and willingness to buy from digitalized SFSCs received moderate-to-low scores. Two regressions showed that buyers’ perceptions of the social impacts that follow digitalization shape both acceptance and willingness. These findings uncovered consumers’ skepticism toward digitalization, suggesting that their commitment to short supply chains and the values that these schemes represent cultivate the belief that digitalization can negatively transform SFSCs, leading to an unwelcome industrialization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","alternative food networks; consumer perceptions; digital agriculture; digital technology; short food supply chains; smart farming; social acceptance","agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; digitization; farming system; food supply; industrialization; perception"

The objective of this study was to develop a structural model to understand how university students use ICT for sustainable digital learning in the areas of social and business sciences. The study investigates the main factors influencing the acceptance of sustainable digital learning based on student satisfaction with the actual use of ICT. This research employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SEM-AMOS and utilizes a questionnaire based on the conceptual framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), its variants, and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) as the primary method of data collection, from which 728 valid responses were obtained. Student responses were classified into several constructs and evaluated to determine their satisfaction with ICT for sustainable digital learning. The findings revealed a significant connection between computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and perceived enjoyment towards perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which in turn positively influenced student satisfaction with the use of ICT. This model proved effective in explaining student satisfaction and highlights the importance of deeply and strategically integrating ICT into educational design to promote digital learning as sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","educational design; ICT; student satisfaction; sustainability; sustainable digital learning; TAM","adoption behavior; business; communication; digitization; education; information technology; numerical model; student; sustainability"

Residential Photovoltaic (PV) systems offer greener electricity generation potential, yet adoption remains low. This study proposes a new framework to explain and predict the ‘intention’ and ‘actual adoption’ of residential PV. The framework integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the Perceived Value Model (PVM). The UTAUT2 provides exogenous variables to the framework, while the PVM consolidates the variables through endogenous (mediating) variables. Three context-specific predictors – ‘green technology awareness’, ‘social responsibility’, and ‘trust’ – are used. A cross-sectional, self-administered survey was performed to validate the framework. Useable responses were obtained from 182 respondents, comprising both adopters and non-adopters of residential PV in Indonesia. The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used for the main analysis. The results indicate that, among the non-adopters, dual paths of significant relationships that lead to perceived value and intention to use are observable; specifically, from (a) ‘performance expectancy’ and ‘green technology awareness’ to ‘perceived benefits’, and (b) ‘price value’ to ‘perceived sacrifice’. Non-adopters equally consider perceived benefits and perceived sacrifice in regard to intent to adopt residential PV. For adopters, evidence suggests non-significant causal paths from exogenous variables to ‘perceived sacrifice’ and ‘perceived value’. Adopters may overlook the perceived sacrifice and all the predictors when adopting residential PV. For both adopters and non-adopters, hedonic motivation becomes a direct predictor of intention. The results offer useful insights for policymakers and practitioners, as adopters and non-adopters could have different attitudes toward solar PV adoption/utilisation, requiring different policy strategies. For instance, the government should simultaneously address predictors of perceived benefits and perceived sacrifice in order to improve residential PV uptake. Meanwhile, to sustain the utilisation of residential PV by adopters, interventions around perceived benefits need to be emphasised, specifically improving green technology awareness and system efficiency (i.e., ‘performance expectancy’). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; And actual usage; Intention; Perceived value model; Residential photovoltaic; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2",""

To understand the public's perspective, this research employed a questionnaire survey. With a remarkable response rate of 85.9 %, 460 questionnaires were distributed and 395 were returned, providing a robust dataset for analysis. This high participation level demonstrates the public's interest in the issue, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of their perceptions and concerns regarding WtE technology. The results show heightened environmental awareness and resource shortage concerns among residents. While acknowledging WtE benefits, a lack of technical understanding fuels anxieties about odor and health risks, manifesting as a “Not-In-My-Backyard” (NIMBY) syndrome. Age, education, and proximity to WtE plants influence awareness and acceptance, with higher levels observed in urban residents, older age groups, and those closer to existing WtE plants. While perceived environmental awareness and recognition of WtE doesn't directly impact attitudes, perceived risks and benefits, especially risks, significantly influence public attitude and acceptance of WtE. To promote WtE development, targeted education campaigns, standardized waste management, and robust environmental regulations are crucial.

The theoretical contribution of this research is to enrich the literature related to the factors affecting the adoption of digital currencies and its impact on the circular economy. Also, due to the importance of technology mindfulness in Industry 5, its effect on the adoption of digital currencies was evaluated. For several decades, Iran has been exposed to political and economic sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, the US, and the European Union (EU). Given the importance of natural resources in Iran's economy, and the presence of barriers regarding financial transactions, all manufacturing companies working in Iran were selected as the statistical population of the current study. The findings showed that variables like the realized ease of use, the realized efficiency, trust, technological mindfulness and social influence have been effective on the acceptance and use of cryptocurrencies. Also, use of cryptocurrencies in manufacturing companies has had effect on the circular economy activities. The other research results revealed that the factor of economic sanction in the studied society might have effect on the use of cryptocurrencies and consequently companies' circular economy.

In response, we match a unique dataset on media attention with electric vehicle (EV) sales data in China, employing a two-way fixed effects model and an instrumental variable (IV) method to estimate the impact of media attention on EV adoption. Our research found that media attention significantly accelerates the market diffusion of EVs. This result is substantiated through IV tests and a series of robustness checks. Additionally, the mediation effect model revealed that media attention indirectly influences EV adoption through consumer EV attention, government EV focus, EV technological innovation, and EV purchase subsidies. We also discovered that the effect of media attention on EV adoption is not only positively moderated by the level of consumer policy awareness and education but is also more pronounced in areas with high population density, high income, high education levels, and a high air quality index.

Using urban households survey data (N = 216) from low-medium income townships of Lilongwe, Malawi, this paper assesses the acceptability and user perceptions of the Mimi Moto (MM), a fan-propelled pellet-fed gasifier cookstove that was distributed through a targeted marketing model. Findings reveal both very high popularity (91 % of users) of the MM despite stove stacking behavior characterized by households owning 2–3 stoves. Over 77 % of the respondents used the MM as primary cookstove. The performance measures and socio-cultural acceptance of the MM were rated as “high” to “very high”. Cooking timesaving emerged as the most significant benefit of the MM, alongside reduced fuel consumption and expenses. Challenges identified include high stove prices, inconsistent fuel quality, and limited access to fuel distribution and stove-maintenance services. Findings highlight the popularity of installment payment methods with 77 % of respondents favoring this option, including 39.2 % who prefer payroll deduction. The study is among the rising few that focuses on urban settings. Findings suggest that the MM cookstove can offer a cleaner stack alternative to support a realistic goal of clean cooking and energy transition (SDG 7) in urban Malawi. This will benefit from effective distribution strategies to boost gasifiers uptake. Notably, emphasizing stove-cost reduction through creative financing and subsidies to ease acquisition; ensuring high-quality pellets and sustainable supply; providing stove maintenance and repair support; and underscoring cooking time and fuel savings along with health and environmental benefits in promotional messages are key. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofuel; Clean energy; Cleaner stack; Gasifier; Improved cookstoves; Malawi; SDG 7","Biofuels; Stoves; Biomass Gasification; Clean energy; Cleaner stack; Cooking technology; Distribution models; Gasification technologies; Gasifiers; Improved cookstove; Malawi; SDG 7; Cost reduction; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; biomass; carbon emission; fuel consumption; marketing; Sustainable Development Goal; urban area"

As the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions has been proven effective but insufficient on its own, Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies emerged to fill the gap. Using CCU technologies, CO<inf>2</inf> is captured and further processed into valuable products instead of being emitted into the atmosphere. Method: This study investigates the prevailing public perception of such CCU-based products by the example of clothing and cosmetics. We applied the method of conjoint measurement to experimentally examine context-related factors (= attributes) in different usage settings and explored the consumers’ decision profiles for or against the usage of CCU-based products (cosmetics and clothing). Conjoint measurements were realized as an online experiment, addressing acceptance patterns and preferences in four European countries (Germany, Norway, Spain, and Poland). In addition, we assessed general attitudes and affective assessments of the CCU products. A total of N = 828 participants took part in the study, and the international subsamples were comparable. Results: Results revealed that health compatibility is the main adoption-driving factor in the decisions for or against the use of the products. Still, attributes like the environmental impact, product quality, and information flow play an important role as well, even though to a lesser extent. Participants from different countries significantly differ in their cognitive and affective evaluations of acceptance-related attributes. Conclusions: The outcome provides insights into differences in Pan-European comparison and helps to understand the public motives and country-specific terms of use for CCU-based products, effectively establishing recommendations for policy and governance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon capture and utilization; CCU-based products; Conjoint analysis; Public perception; Social acceptance","Carbon dioxide; Cosmetics; Disasters; Environmental impact; Global warming; % reductions; Carbon capture and utilization; Carbon capture and utilization-based product; Carbon-based; Conjoint analysis; Conjoint measurement; European Countries; Natural disasters; Public perception; Social acceptance; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental impact assessment; global warming; local participation; perception; Germany; Norway; Poland [Central Europe]; Spain"

The research model adapts an internationally comparative framework and extends the well-established unified theory of acceptance and use of the technology model with the concept of perceived risk and trust. We explore user attitudes with a survey on a large Hungarian sample and analyze the database with consistent partial least square structural equation modeling methodology. The results show that users would be primarily influenced by the expected usefulness of the new technology assuming it is easy to use. Furthermore, our analysis also highlights that while social influence does not seem to sway user opinions, consumers are susceptible to technological risks, and trust is an important determinant of their openness toward innovations in financial services.

The same would assist Electric Vehicle (EV) stakeholders in directing their efforts toward pivotal aspects having the potential to significantly bolster E2W penetration. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected using convenience sampling technique from 1,254 electric two-wheeler owners across four Indian states and analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling. Findings: Performance Expectancy, Price Value and Hedonic Motivation have a significant influence on purchase intention leading to actual buying behavior. Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, habit value and facilitating conditions were insignificant. Pro-Environmental Approach and Government Support significantly impact adoption intention and behavior respectively in addition to model predictors thus supporting the study’s novelty. Purchase intention proved to influence Actual Buying Behavior. Synergized efforts of EV stakeholders towards performance innovation, cost-effectiveness, improved infrastructure and information diffusion on sustainability and user-friendliness could aid in achieving transition to green mobility.

Damaged dwellings cannot be immediately reinforced to continue inhabitation, generating disruption. Repairs are usually costly, as large numbers of affected constructions make damage assessment difficult, and post-earthquake reconstruction programmes often lack a heritage-specific approach. This research seeks to address these issues through a methodology based on high-end documentation technologies applied to built heritage and local community engagement. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology proposed combines different recording tools to capture social and built environment data, such as interviews, mapping, drone capture, photography and 3D laser scanning, in the pilot case study of Bela, a historical settlement in the seismic region of Kutch in Gujarat, India, affected by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake. This paper particularly discusses aspects of community engagement around data capture and representation processes. Findings: The introduction of advanced documentation technologies can help speed up the process of damage assessment, analyse social aspects that are key to a respectful re-construction, and enhance community engagement through visual representations, which are relevant to social acceptance and understanding towards a meaningful introduction and sustained use in earthquake risk management. Research limitations/implications: The methodology proposed can inform similar cases in seismic areas and enhance engagement, helping to develop a sense of awareness in the community regarding the need for preparedness in the face of earthquakes. However, there are technical challenges in using advanced recording technologies in terms of equipment accessibility, skills, knowledge and future uses of the data. Social and cultural aspects, such as caste and gender divisions, also implied disparity in accessing the data and relating it to the research team, bringing forward the need to tailor public engagement to achieve inclusivity. Practical implications: This study has practical implications. The most relevant one is how the process of carrying out the research served as a way to raise awareness for future seismic events. In this regard, local academic institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are critical mediators in reaching the community in greater depth, from which to bridge to external and/or governmental agencies based on existing links and trust. Social implications: This study also shows social implications. As a case study-based research, the link developed with the local community will help coordinate actions in case an earthquake occurs and increase cohesion within the community towards a joint aim, in this case, to reduce the risk of disasters due to seismic events. Originality/value: This paper accounts for a novel approach to documenting buildings in heritage settlements prone to earthquakes that uses the digital record as (1) a basis to assess and intervene in the built environment and better understand how it supports the local community’s ways of living and maintaining buildings; and (2) a platform for local engagement and agency in planning and re-construction as a post-disaster mitigation measure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bela; Built heritage; Community engagement; Digital documentation; Earthquake risk management; Re-construction",""

The relationships were analyzed with PLS-SEM established with the participation of 414 electric vehicle users. Subjective Norms and Image directly impact Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Intention to Use. It has been determined that Compatibility has a direct effect on Ease of Use and an indirect effect on Usefulness and Intention. According to this study, in which most people are dissatisfied with charging and range issues, the opinion of the social environment and family is the most important external factor affecting intention. Our findings suggest improving the charging station network and technology, as well as implementing informative activities related to the features of electric vehicles, in order to contribute to users’ adoption of electric vehicles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","compatibility; electric cars; image; PLS-SEM; subjective norm; technology acceptance model","decision making; detection method; electric vehicle; perception; spatiotemporal analysis; Turkey"

Using bibliometric analysis, it examined a collection of 561 studies from the Web of Science and Scopus databases to detect the thematic evolution, strategy map, and emerging trends in SEBM literature as well as to forecast research directions. The results showed that SEBMs is a relatively new multidisciplinary research area that grew rapidly between 2014 and 2019; since then, the publication growth has flattened. Research on SEBMs currently focuses on sustainability, sustainable development, tourism, new technology application, and business management, with less attention given to social effects and public acceptance, determinants of success, and regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. The thematic analysis revealed that sustainability-oriented themes are at the center. Six emerging trends were detected: (1) industry-oriented research such as transportation, tourism, accommodation, energy, and others, (2) sustainability-oriented studies, including social, environmental, and economic perspectives, (3) sustainable organizational development concerning social acceptance, trust, legitimacy, and satisfaction, (4) new technology-oriented and innovation-focused studies such as blockchain, big data, social media, and e-platforms, (5) country- and region-oriented studies, particularly for emerging countries, (6) effects of entrepreneurial ecosystem factors on SEBM development. Based on the current thematic map and evolution, this paper suggests several critical research directions. The paper provides (1) providing a one-stop literature overview on SEBM area for two time slices: fast-growing-initiation phase (before COVID-19) and transitional phase (during COVID-19), (2) identifying research focuses, emerging trends, and gaps, (3) developing novel research avenues for investigation, and (4) aligning expected contributions to the area.

Oil palm is one of the biggest contributors to Indonesia’s revenues, thus fueling its economy. Using remote sensing would allow a plantation to monitor and forecast its production and the amount of fertilizer used. This review aims to provide a policy recommendation in the form of a strategy to improve the added value of Indonesia’s oil palm and support the government in increasing oil palm production. This recommendation needs to be formulated by determining the users’ acceptance of remote sensing technology (state-owned plantations, private plantation companies and smallholder plantations). Design/methodology/approach: This review’s methodology used sentiment analysis through text mining (bag of words model). The study’s primary data were from focus group discussions (FGDs), questionnaires, observations on participants, audio-visual documentation and focused discussions based on group category. The results of interviews and FGDs were transcribed into text and analyzed to 1) find words that can represent the content of the document; 2) classify and determine the frequency (word cloud); and finally 3) analyze the sentiment. Findings: The result showed that private plantation companies and state-owned plantations had extremely high positive sentiments toward using remote sensing in their oil palm plantations, whereas smallholders had a 60% resistance. However, there is still a possibility for this technology’s adoption by smallholders, provided it is free and easily applied. Research limitations/implications: Basically, technology is applied to make work easier. However, not everyone is tech-savvy, especially the older generations. One dimension of technology acceptance is user/customer retention. New technology would not be immediately accepted, but there would be user perceptions about its uses and ease. At first, people might be reluctant to accept a new technology due to the perception that it is useless and difficult. Technology acceptance is the gauge of how useful technology is in making work easier compared to conventional ways. Practical implications: Therefore, technology acceptance needs to be improved among smallholders by intensively socializing the policies, and through dissemination and dedication by academics and the government. Social implications: The social implications of using technology are reducing the workforce, but the company will be more profitable and efficient. Originality/value: Remote sensing is one of the topics that people have not taken up in a large way, especially sentiment analysis. Acceptance of technology that utilizes remote sensing for plantations is very useful and efficient. In the end, company profits can be allocated more toward empowering the community and the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Oil palm; Remote sensing; Sentiment analysis; Technology acceptance","fertilizer; plantation; questionnaire survey; remote sensing; smallholder; strategic approach; Indonesia"

This Faculty-Led Program provides valuable opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge in foreign environments. Design/methodology/approach: Students from Universidad del Pacífico and Rochester Institute of Technology were exposed to the food and beverages industry in Lima and New York. The theory will be presented to justify the program’s positive impact on the human development of the participating countries and empirical evidence of training capabilities that it allowed, according to the theoretical framework proposed by (Braskamp et al., 2009), to identify dimensions of learning. The study was based on primary data collected from 20 students from Universidad del Pacífico through a participant observation approach, retrieving a final essay project and the students’ testimonies at the end of the program implemented in other similar studies in Peru (Simone, 2021). The data were categorized into three domains and then summarized to provide key insights. In this case, the methodology is qualitative, but the data were also subjected to statistical analysis. Findings: The results suggest that knowledge of the value chain of food and beverages obtained in this program was successfully consolidated. The learning outcomes from this method were obtained through students’ projects aimed to share the learned global practices with the industry and were materialized in three domains: the cognitive domain, with students recognizing and valuing cultural aspects; the interpersonal domain, students learned from social interactions with stakeholders; and the intrapersonal domain, students showed high acceptance of US culture within the course context, though their affect toward it was more potent than toward their own culture. These domains allowed students to assess how such international experience impacted their learning in more than just the academic outcome. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on self-reported subjective methods in the short term since it summarizes students’ perspectives, expressed in a final written essay, regarding three main dimensions of learning. Besides, the process assesses the improvement of those dimensions through a participant observation approach and collecting testimonies. More objective, comparable outcomes could be achieved in the medium term by evaluating the participants’ performance in the business world.

To address this issue, this study adopts a mixed-methods research design to investigate Chinese EFL (English-as-a-foreign-language) learners’ virtual experience in distance English learning, based on theories of positive psychology and technology acceptance model (TAM). Participants were 323 students from junior high schools and 398 students from senior high schools in China. Data were collected by both questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative results from independent samples t-tests and structural equation modeling (SEM) indicate that, first, junior high school students reported a significantly more positive perception than senior sample in all six measured constructs. Second, the predictive effects of social presence and flow on technology acceptance were broadly confirmed in both groups. Qualitative analysis reveals that learners had complex and multifaceted perceptions, highlighting the two-sided nature of distance English learning: technology can be both facilitating and challenging.

However, the specific norms—personal, descriptive, and subjective—that influence behavioral intentions regarding AV adoption remain underexplored. This research addresses this gap by integrating the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) with pro-environmental variables to examine both direct and indirect influences on behavioral intentions. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the proposed model was validated with data from 516 domestic Chinese tourists. The findings highlight that subjective norms and trust significantly shape positive intentions toward adopting autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, environmental knowledge and concerns exert a significant indirect impact on these intentions, underscoring the complex interplay of factors that drive pro-environmental behavior.

Using an experimental approach with 371 participants in the United Kingdom, this research explores how the disclosure of virtual human technology influences trust, performance perception, usage likelihood, and overall acceptance. Participants interacted with virtual humans in simulations, initially unaware of their virtual nature, and then completed surveys to capture their perceptions before and after disclosure. The results indicate that trust and acceptance are higher in social media contexts, whereas business and general settings reveal significant negative shifts post-disclosure. Trust emerged as a critical factor influencing overall acceptance, with social media interactions maintaining higher levels of trust and performance perceptions than business environments and general interactions. A qualitative analysis of open-ended responses and follow-up interviews highlights concerns about transparency, security, and the lack of human touch. Participants expressed fears about data exploitation and the ethical implications of virtual human technology, particularly in business and personal settings. This study underscores the importance of ethical guidelines and transparent protocols to enhance the adoption of virtual humans in diverse sectors.

Social influence, perceived security, personal innovativeness, and affective event reaction are applied to the research model. Questionnaires are distributed among several listed express companies and 263 valid questionnaires are used for empirical testing. Empirical results indicated that social influence, perceived safety, personal innovativeness and affective event reaction are positively related to usage with coefficients 0.218, 0.301, 0.698 and 0.309. Personal innovativeness has positive moderating effects on relationships between affective event reaction, perceived security and usage, with coefficients 0.145 and 0.106; however, it has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between social influence and usage.

A key factor for the human acceptance of these robots is their awareness of environmental and social norms. In this paper, we introduce SONAR (for SOcial Norm Aware Robots), a novel robot-agnostic control architecture aimed at enabling social agents to autonomously recognize, act upon, and learn over time social norms during interactions with humans. SONAR integrates several state-of-the-art theories and technologies, including the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of reasoning and decision making for rational agents, fuzzy logic theory, and large language models, to support adaptive and norm-aware autonomous decision making. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of SONAR via real-life experiments involving human-robot interactions (HRI) using a Nao robot for scenarios of casual conversations between the robot and each participant. The results of our experiments show that our SONAR implementation can effectively and efficiently be used in HRI to provide the robot with environmental and social and norm awareness. Compared to a robot with no explicit social and norm awareness, introducing social and norm awareness via SONAR results in interactions that are perceived as more positive and enjoyable by humans, as well as in higher perceived trust in the social robot. Moreover, we investigate, via computer-based simulations, the extent to which SONAR can be used to learn and adapt to the social norms of different societies. The results of these simulations illustrate that SONAR can successfully learn adequate behaviors in a society from a relatively small amount of data. We publicly release the source code of SONAR, along with data and experiments logs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Belief-desire-intention; Fuzzy logic; Large language models; Norm adaptation; Social norm-aware robots; Social norms; Social robots","Adaptive control systems; Autonomous agents; Chatbots; Microrobots; Robot learning; Sonar; Belief-desire-intentions; Fuzzy-Logic; Language model; Large language model; Learn+; Norm adaptation; Social norm; Social norm-aware robot; Social robots"

Increasingly, it is recognised that such behaviour changes cause further effects in individuals' lifestyles, which are important to understand for the success of such low-carbon behaviour changes. Rebound effects can occur that undermine the carbon savings, and individual well-being can suffer leading to decreased acceptance of changes and undermine broader sustainability goals. This paper systematically and empirically maps what types of effects individuals experience with low-carbon lifestyle changes, what desirable effects are encouraged and how undesirable effects can be addressed and how undesirable effects can be addressed. For this purpose, we adopted a qualitative research approach, conducting five workshops with a total of 84 participants across five EU countries (Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Spain, Sweden) who had changed their lifestyles by adopting significant low-carbon lifestyle options. In the workshops, the consequences of four low-carbon lifestyle changes – giving up (1) car ownership, (2) flying, (3) meat, or (4) living space – were explored using simplified cause-effect diagrams, personal written reflections and discussions in focus groups. Our results point to the relevance of intrinsic motivation to explain the likelihood for rebounding as well as the other social effects of the behaviour change on the individual and household. Findings indicated a wide range of both negative and positive effects related to feelings and perceptions of individual freedom, mental and physical conditions, and social consequences. Intrinsically motivated individuals showed a high awareness of the problem of rebounding and appeared more able to cope with negative consequences in general and reduce them. Monetary savings from a behaviour change increase the likelihood for rebounding; however, citizens with higher environmental awareness reported re-spending on other low-carbon behaviours and technologies indicating positive spillover effects. Finally, we observed the strong supporting effects of social communities for individuals to manage the negative consequences of low-carbon behaviour changes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consequences; Rebound; Spillover; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable lifestyles","Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; Zero-carbon; Behaviour changes; Carbon behavior; Consequence; Low carbon; Low-carbon lifestyles; Rebound; Spillover; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable lifestyle; Undesirable effects; Carbon capture and utilization"

At this early stage of development, there are still major uncertainties about the extent to which CCU can help mitigate climate change due economic and technological challenges. This study focuses on an additional complication in the development and deployment of CCU: how the public perceives its benefits, risks, and acceptability. In a nationally representative study of U.S. adults (N = 1200), we examined (1) overall support for CCU; (2) public expectations about CCU's effects on health, the economy, and climate change; and (3) whether perceptions vary depending on which aspects of CCU are discussed (general overview of CCU, proposed local facility, or using CCU-derived products). Using an oversample of Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American participants (n = 471, total N = 1671), we also explored how beliefs differed across race/ethnicity and gender as well as the influence of psychological traits of environmentalist identity and aversion to tampering with nature. We found that the U.S. public had moderately positive views of CCU overall, with important nuances. First, people were less positive about CCU facilities in their home communities than they were about the idea of CCU in general or about products made with CCU. Second, people believed CCU would benefit the economy more than health or climate change. Third, individual differences in demographics and psychological traits matter for perceptions: (1) women were more wary of CCU than men, and (2) while White participants had more positive views about CCU the more they identified as environmentalists, the same was not always true for Hispanic or Black respondents. The study, thus, reveals the nuanced ways in which different American audiences may respond to CCU proposals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon capture and utilization; CCU; Climate change communication; Public acceptance; Public opinion","Carbon capture; Social aspects; Carbon capture and utilization; Climate change communication; Climate change mitigation; Economic challenges; Hispanics; Public acceptance; Public opinions; Public perception; Uncertainty; Climate change"

Previous research has indicated that social factors play a crucial role in the adoption of rooftop solar. Still, the influence of subjective norms on battery storage, a relatively invisible technology, has yet to be fully understood. An online survey from homeowners in Australia, a mature renewable energy market, is used to provide insights into market acceptance that are relevant to international energy markets. A two-step econometric model, using factor analysis and ordered logistic regression, was used for data analysis. The results show that subjective norms, moral emotions and an environmental self-identity are positively associated with market acceptance. Demographic factors, such as younger age and higher levels of education, predict market acceptance. Motives such as technical interest, autarky and load-shifting behaviours are also relevant. Several recommendations for policymakers and practitioners are offered to improve the acceptance of battery storage, including interventions that exploit social parameters and appeal to consumer psychology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barriers; Battery storage; Demographics; Prosumers; Regression analysis; Social–psychological drivers","Battery storage; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Factor analysis; Population statistics; Power markets; Australia; Barrier; Demographic; Demographic factors; Economic factors; Market acceptance; Prosumer; Social–psychological driver; Subjective norm; Regression analysis; alternative energy; energy storage; equipment; factor analysis; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; consumer attitude; human; power supply; questionnaire; Consumer Behavior; Electric Power Supplies; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Adopting an empirical bioethics framework, this stakeholder interview study shows that respecting species borders is important, but not decisive, for acceptance among Norwegian stakeholders. The main objections are based on moral reflections about technology use and outcomes.

As green innovations are often more complex and costly to develop or operate than are conventional innovations, it is important to assess whether consumers truly value the environmental benefits associated with green innovations. Focusing on the specific case of the air transport industry, we investigate whether air passengers are willing to pay more for greener flights (i.e., using new technologies that have lower greenhouse gas emissions). To do so, we conduct a choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis in which respondents are confronted with several product profiles for a plane ticket. The sample comprises 17,325 choices made by 1155 respondents from North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The results reveal passengers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) (in euros) to switch from traditional jet fuel to different technological options that emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions than does kerosene. The results also investigate whether passengers are willing to accept longer flight times, which is an alternative operational method for reducing CO2 emissions. Additional analyses reveal that attitudes toward air transport (flight shame and trust in the aviation industry) and general pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors increase the WTP of passengers for greener innovations, while sociodemographics (age, gender and education) have no significant impact on WTP. This research extends the literature on green innovation by underlining the importance of its social acceptance and by highlighting under which circumstances consumers are willing to pay more for green innovations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Choice-based conjoint analysis; Green innovation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable aviation; Willingness-to-pay","Green development; Green economy; Kyoto Protocol; Low emission; Air passengers; Air transport industry; Choice-based conjoint; Choice-based conjoint analyze; Conjoint analysis; Environmental benefits; Green innovations; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable aviation; Willingness to pay"

Stakeholders’ perspectives, particularly those of frontline workers in relevant fields, are crucial for understanding the nuances of a just transition. However, research in this domain, especially concerning the glass manufacturing industry, remains yet sparse. The current study fills this gap by developing an integrated framework that assesses the attitude of practitioners towards a low-carbon transition, as evidenced by their stance on implementing sustainable energy technologies (SET) in glass production. It also explores disparities among different groups to detect potential injustice issues, and examines the factors that drive their support for SET. Utilizing survey data from 270 frontline practitioners within glass manufacturing corporations in China, we have obtained a preliminary understanding of their opinions toward SET, and uncovered variances indicative of justice-related concerns. We delved deeper into the determinants of SET support using a three-dimensional model and hierarchical regression analysis. Our findings indicate that social-psychological attributes, perceived intrinsic qualities of SET, and perceived extrinsic contextual elements are all significant motivators for the acceptance of SET. In light of these insights, we propose recommendations for policymaking and environmental communication that incorporate considerations of justice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy-intensive sector; Glass industry; Just transition; Sustainable energy technologies; Technology acceptance","Digital storage; Energy conservation; Glass industry; Glass transition; Industrial research; Regression analysis; 'current; Energy intensive industries; Energy-intensive sectors; Front-line workers; Glass-manufacturing; Just transition; Manufacturing industries; Sustainable energy technology; Technical solutions; Technology acceptance; Glass; alternative energy; environmental justice; manufacturing; policy making; regression analysis; technology adoption; three-dimensional modeling; China"

The examination of factors that shape public support for CCS projects provides policymakers with insights to address public concerns, balance CCS development with public sentiments, and make informed decisions about optimal locations and timing. Based on a nationally representative survey on 1850 respondents, the study finds that in the US, there is very low familiarity (6.4%) regarding CCS technology and some limited opposition (11.5%) to increased CCS development. Regression results suggest that support for increased CCS projects in the US is influenced by perceptions of technical and social risks (leakage and community danger, respectively) but not cost of living risks, perceptions of environmental and economic benefits, familiarity with the technology, confidence in government regulations, and a desire for the US to lead in CCS. We fail to find the ‘Not-in-My-Backyard’ effect, and individuals supporting the development of more CCS in their states also support it at a national level. Understanding these factors helps policymakers anticipate challenges in implementing CCS initiatives and allows for the development of strategies to address concerns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic benefits; National survey; NIMBY; Ordered probit; Public perception; Technology","Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Risk perception; Economic benefits; National surveys; NIMBY; Ordered probit; Policy makers; Public acceptance; Public concern; Public perception; Public support; Technology; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; decision making; environmental economics; perception; questionnaire survey; technology; aged; article; carbon capture and storage; controlled study; cost of living; female; government regulation; human; male; public opinion; United States; young adult; questionnaire; Carbon Sequestration; Humans; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires"

While during the pandemic years predominantly all formal learning was forced to move online, in the postpandemic environment traditional postsecondary education institutions generally resumed in-person (or face-to-face) learning. Nonetheless, it is possible that some students would like to continue using online learning after using such a system during COVID-19 restrictions. Therefore, it is important for postsecondary institutions to understand students’ views on continuing with online learning so that these institutions can better adapt their offerings to learners’ preferences. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a cross-sectional online survey-based approach grounded on an innovative theoretical framework blending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 into the expectation-confirmation model of information systems continuance. Data were collected from 247 students in Canada in Fall 2022 and were analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling techniques. Findings: Perceptions of usefulness and of monetary benefits relative to costs together with developing positive habits regarding online learning are the most significant beliefs motivating students to want to continue with online learning. Furthermore, positive disconfirmation of initial expectations and satisfaction relying on previous use together with a favorable attitude with respect to online learning strongly influence the intention to continue with online education. Originality/value: The study opens the door for similar research in other cultural contexts (e.g. with a different individualistic-collectivistic pattern) and for other domains that moved totally online during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. primary health care) to maximize people satisfaction while minimizing societal costs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19 pandemic; Information systems continuance; Information technology adoption; Online learning; Postsecondary education; Technology acceptance and use","Blending; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Online systems; Students; Continuance intentions; COVID-19 pandemic; Empirical investigation; Information system continuances; Information technology adoption; Learning continuances; Online learning; Postsecondary education; Technology acceptance; Technology use; COVID-19"

The development of 5G technology supports social, economic and environmental sustainability together. Among other things, innovative communities, economic progress and a reduction of the carbon footprint can be positive outcomes of 5G. For example 5G benefits the environment in two ways: it helps telecom operators reduce their energy usage, thus lowering their environmental impact, and it provides tools that telecom companies can use to assist others in reducing their environmental footprint. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression method was used to establish the correlations between the five factor groups. Research indicates a prevalent skepticism among Hungarian consumers toward 5G technology, characterized by apprehensions regarding health risks and a lack of perceived competitive advantages or inherent business benefits to adopting 5G. This hesitancy must be countered by transparently addressing health concerns, debunking myths, and building a foundational trust in 5G technologies through comprehensive educational and awareness-raising initiatives, aligning technological advancements with consumer confidence and acceptance. 5G must be demystified so that consumers will come to trust the technology and embrace its adoption.

Direct potable reuse (DPR) has been considered a promising strategy to guarantee public supply in regions with severe problems with water scarcity and high-water demand. The success of reuse practices mainly depends on the triad technology, regulation, and public acceptance. This study investigated public acceptance as a technical parameter to assess the implementation feasibility of DPR in large cities of developing countries. Residents of Campinas City (São Paulo, Brazil) were consulted through a multiple-response questionnaire addressing sociodemographic aspects, personal environmental perceptions, and the acceptable uses for wastewater reuse. The results showed a low rejection rate (∼7%) to DPR despite this not being regulated in Brazil. A total of 47% of the volunteers declared that they would accept the DPR of domestic sewage after appropriate treatments and technologies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 46% would accept it after more information. Age was an essential factor for DPR acceptance, being greater among those between 30 and 45 years old. No statistically significant differences in potable reuse acceptability were observed among participants' sex and self-declaration of race. The majority of volunteers (85%) considered water reuse very important, and most participants (51%) already practice non-potable household water reuse daily and do so out of environmental awareness. Trust in the water supply concessionaire was a key factor in DPR acceptance. This study is essential for discussing innovative public-oriented solutions to achieve water security in developing countries, especially considering the scarcity of investigations on DPR acceptability in South America. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental awareness; Public acceptance; Public opinion survey; Water reuse; Water security","Biodiversity; Potable water; Sewage; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water supply; Environmental aspects; Environmental awareness; Opinion surveys; Potable reuse; Public acceptance; Public opinion survey; Public opinions; Water reuse; Water scarcity; Water security; Developing countries"

Despite this academic gap, Mexico has signed up for the United Nations SDGs, which include producing clean and affordable energy and reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions to slow global warming. The country is, therefore, committed to implementing measures to help achieve these goals. This study is the first multidisciplinary analysis performed at a national level in Mexico, aimed at identifying sites for efficient Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) production while considering socioeconomic needs, environmental risks, and societal acceptance of the new technologies. We first calculated the energy potential from nearshore winds, waves, marine currents, and offshore thermal gradients. The results show that electricity needs are greater in the 11 states where levels of marginalization are highest. The production of MRE is feasible in three of these regions.

With grass supplies readily available and the potentially significant carbon footprint reduction that this technology offers, this is an opportunity for sustainable production of much-needed food ingredients for human consumption. This study investigates UK consumers’ acceptance of grass-derived ingredients and examines the factors influencing their willingness to adopt these innovations as part of their diets. This study was conducted through a cross-sectional study in the UK, in which the participants were divided into three groups based on meat avoidance, i.e., meat reducers, meat avoiders, and meat consumers. The key findings emphasise the importance of education on grass-derived products to enhance consumer awareness and confidence. Other factors—such as age, meat attachment, grass-derived ingredients’ characteristics, social norms, and attitudes—have influenced willingness to try (WTT)/accept grass-derived ingredients. The findings suggest that while grass-derived ingredients in human diets may struggle to gain positive perceptions, targeted product development and marketing strategies tailored to highlight grass-derived ingredients’ nutritional benefits and safety are key to reshaping perceptions and fostering consumer readiness for novel food technologies in the UK. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","grass; grass-derived ingredients; novel food technology; sustainability; UK consumers’ acceptance; willingness to try; WTT","carbon footprint; consumption behavior; cross section; food production; grass; marketing; meat; product development; sustainability; sustainable development; United Kingdom"

This study adapts and extends the UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model to investigate the determinants of acceptance for autonomous food delivery robots. We examine the impacts of privacy and security concerns on the relationship between social influence and adoption behaviour. In addition, the relationship between environmental friendliness and behavioural intention toward adoption is examined. These factors are fairly unexplored in previous studies in the context of food ADRs. In doing so, the study collected 590 online responses from potential customers using a random sampling technique. The results showed that both moderation effects of privacy concerns and security concerns are supported and both variables deteriorated the social influence of adoption. In addition, the negative relationship between contactless delivery and the adoption of ADRs was confirmed in this study. Furthermore, the results confirmed the positive impact of environmental friendliness on the adoption of food ADRs.

Around 40% of global emissions come from residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, this study developed a green building adoption model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which encourages firms to implement these novel green building technologies. For this, a survey of 333 respondents from Pakistani construction firms was conducted, and Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling approach was applied to validate the study's hypotheses. The findings showed that green building adoption provided invaluable insight by showing the strong associations between green building environmental concern, green building performance expectancy, green building effort expectancy, green building social influence, and green building innovation cost with green building behavioral intentions. Likewise, the findings also showed that green building behavioral intentions play a significant mediating role between the adoption of green buildings and its factors. The findings from this study suggest that intentions to engage in green building activities have a strong direct and mediating effect on green building adoption. Furthermore, the moderating effect of firm size demonstrated the significant differences between small, medium, and large firms size. Based on the study’ findings, the green building adoption model provided novel insights for governments and concerned stakeholders, including construction firms, to adopt green buildings for carbon neutrality in this era of climate emergency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate emergency; green behavioral intentions; green building adoption; green building innovation cost; green building performance expectancy; green building social influence","building; carbon emission; construction industry; emission control; innovation; least squares method; performance assessment; sustainability; Pakistan"

This concept of governance spaces highlights the variable configurations of technologies and their interactions with humans, and helps avoid the tendency to see technologies as passive relays that transmit power originating elsewhere, or, in contrast, to overstate the almost magical autonomous capacities of technology. The concept of legitimacy is valuable for evaluating the degree to which technologies are effective and deserving of support. The article draws on Mark Suchman’s distinction between pragmatic, moral and cognitive legitimacy, which correspond in turn to interests, ethical values, and facts. In contrast to more conventional state-centered conceptions of legitimacy, these aspects of legitimacy can be applied to governance spaces constituted by technologies. The article then examines and compares the cases of technologies for countering human trafficking and COVID-19 digital contact tracing apps. In both cases all three aspects of legitimacy are present, important, and interconnected. An examination of a recent report issued by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Tech Against Trafficking coalition on 305 anti-trafficking tools shows the role of ethics and facts in their legitimacy, but also the degree to which the tools are skewed towards interests other than those at risk of being trafficked. Acceptance and evaluations of digital contract tracing apps are similarly shaped by the interactions between interests, ethical values, and facts, including evidence about their effectiveness. The legitimacy of COVID-19 digital contact tracing apps involves a wider presence of a public interest in health while the risks associated with power inequalities are greater with anti-trafficking technologies, highlighting the importance of variability in the legitimacy of governance spaces constituted by technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19 contact tracing; digital technology; human trafficking; legitimacy; Transnational governance","COVID-19; environmental management; ethics; trafficking"

Measures included: (i) surveys, (ii) data-prompted interviews (DPIs) with study participants, (iii) semi-structured interviews with implementers, and (iv) intervention access and engagement data. Five themes described the acceptability of the intervention to participants: (i) monitoring behavior change and personal progress to better understand the weight management process, (ii) working collaboratively with the intervention implementers to achieve participants’ goals, (iii) perceived benefits of non-judgmental and problem-solving tone of the intervention, (iv) changes in personal perception of the weight management process due to intervention tailoring, and (v) insufficient intervention content tailoring. The intervention delivery was feasible, however, emails and text messages differed in terms of accessibility and resources required to deliver the content. The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment as a technique to gather personal data for further tailoring was acceptable, and facilitated behavior change monitoring.

A survey questionnaire is designed for data collection (n = 387) and structural equation modelling is applied for data analysis. Our findings suggest gamification affordances of competition, achievement, self-expression, and interactivity as the factors that directly or indirectly influence consumers' intention to engage in green logistics behaviour. This influence is mediated through perceived enjoyment, ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we find that consumers may prioritise social factors such as interactivity affordance over competition and achievement affordances in the gamified green logistics behaviour.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many HEIs have considered diversification through digitalization. From the initial urgency to implement technology at the start of the pandemic to a gradual acceptance over time, HEIs witnessed a shift in perceptions. This paper aims to explore the evolution of the use of technology in HEI classrooms from pre- to post-Covid-19 as seen through the eyes of students and faculty members. Design/methodology/approach: Seven surveys were conducted from March 2020 to January 2023 with faculty members and students at one business HEI in Switzerland. This longitudinal study analyzed the perceptions of faculty and students regarding technology in the ever-changing HEI environments. These results have been used to make practical recommendations for future HEI classroom settings. Findings: The findings reveal that the social aspect must be considered when implementing technology into HEIs. Faculty members and students need appropriate training and adequate resources to engage with the technology in and outside the classroom. The results suggest that one result of the pandemic was a greater acceptance of blended learning practices in traditional business education. Originality/value: The pandemic has left long-lasting effects on teaching and learning. While many HEIs revert to traditional ways, the authors suggest the need to embrace technology that encourages engagement and authentic teaching and learning.

Users are concerned about the unauthorized processing of their personal data, as well as about search engines keeping track of their search preferences. Various search engines have been introduced to address these concerns, claiming that they protect users’ privacy. The authors call these search engines privacy-preserving search engines (PPSEs). This paper aims to investigate the factors that motivate search engine users to use PPSEs. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted protection motivation theory (PMT) and associated its constructs with subjective norms to build a comprehensive research model. The authors tested the research model using survey data from 830 search engine users worldwide. Findings: The results confirm the interpretive power of PMT in privacy-related decision-making and show that users are more inclined to take protective measures when they consider that data abuse is a more severe risk and that they are more vulnerable to data abuse. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of subjective norms in predicting and determining PPSE use. Because subjective norms refer to perceived social influences from important others to engage or refrain from protective behavior, the authors reveal that the recommendation from people that users consider important motivates them to take protective measures and use PPSE. Research limitations/implications: Despite its interesting results, this research also has some limitations. First, because the survey was conducted online, the study environment was less controlled. Participants may have been disrupted or affected, for example, by the presence of others or background noise during the session. Second, some of the survey items could possibly be misinterpreted by the respondents in the study questionnaire, as they did not have access to clarifications that a researcher could possibly provide. Third, another limitation refers to the use of the Amazon Turk tool. According Paolacci and Chandler (2014) in comparison to the US population, the MTurk workers are more educated, younger and less religiously and politically diverse. Fourth, another limitation of this study could be that Actual Use of PPSE is self-reported by the participants. This could cause bias because it is argued that internet users’ statements may be in contrast with their actions in real life or in an experimental scenario (Berendt et al., 2005, Jensen et al., 2005); Moreover, some limitations of this study emerge from the use of PMT as the background theory of the study. PMT identifies the main factors that affect protection motivation, but other environmental and cognitive factors can also have a significant role in determining the way an individual’s attitude is formed. As Rogers (1975) argued, PMT as proposed does not attempt to specify all of the possible factors in a fear appeal that may affect persuasion, but rather a systematic exposition of a limited set of components and cognitive mediational processes that may account for a significant portion of the variance in acceptance by users. In addition, as Tanner et al. (1991) argue, the ‘PMT’s assumption that the subjects have not already developed a coping mechanism is one of its limitations. Finally, another limitation is that the sample does not include users from China, which is the second most populated country. Unfortunately, DuckDuckGo has been blocked in China, so it has not been feasible to include users from China in this study. Practical implications: The proposed model and, specifically, the subjective norms construct proved to be successful in predicting PPSE use. This study demonstrates the need for PPSE to exhibit and advertise the technology and measures they use to protect users’ privacy. This will contribute to the effort to persuade internet users to use these tools. Social implications: This study sought to explore the privacy attitudes of search engine users using PMT and its constructs’ association with subjective norms. It used the PMT to elucidate users’ perceptions that motivate them to privacy adoption behavior, as well as how these perceptions influence the type of search engine they use. This research is a first step toward gaining a better understanding of the processes that drive people’s motivation to, or not to, protect their privacy online by means of using PPSE. At the same time, this study contributes to search engine vendors by revealing that users’ need to be persuaded not only about their policy toward privacy but also by considering and implementing new strategies of diffusion that could enhance the use of the PPSE. Originality/value: This research is a first step toward gaining a better understanding of the processes that drive people’s motivation to, or not to, protect their privacy online by means of using PPSEs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Privacy concerns; Protection motivation theory; Search engines; User motivation","Behavioral research; Decision making; Motivation; Privacy-preserving techniques; Risk assessment; Internet users; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Protection motivation theory; Protective measures; Research models; Subjective norm; User attitudes; User motivation; User privacy; Search engines"

The blockchain-based quality tracking systems are supposed to support a more transparent and trusting quality control process. However, many factors affect the stakeholders' willingness toward the adoption of such quality tracking systems. The purpose of this research is to investigate the key factors that influence the stakeholders' adoption decisions toward the application of the quality tracking system in PCs and develop coping strategies. Design/methodology/approach: An evolutionary game model is established that includes the manufacturer, constructor and developer. Four scenarios of equilibriums and the game's evolutionary stable strategies are analyzed, and the corresponding stability conditions are then obtained. Based on the tripartite game model, two representative projects are used as case studies to simulate how different factors affect the stakeholders' decisions. Findings: First, trade-offs between cost and benefits were the most prominent factor in the adoption decision-making. Second, the advancement of technologies would compensate for their immaturity.

For the future of the developing world, changes in farming and retail practices are crucial. This study introduces a digital system for managing agricultural waste in Thailand that aims to encourage farmers and food retailers to sell their excess agricultural materials. The study’s objectives are as follows: (1) to explore factors that affect users’ behavioral intention to utilize an agriculture waste trading platform; (2) to compare the behavioral differences between farmers and retailers regarding their intention to use a digital platform for sustainable agriculture. Data were gathered from 570 fruit and vegetable sellers and farmers across five provinces in the northeastern region of Thailand. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships between constructs based on the modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), and multigroup analysis (MGA) was employed to analyze differences in path coefficients across groups. The key findings revealed that social influence (SI) had a more significant impact on retailers compared to farmers, while facilitating conditions (FC), habits (HB), and privacy (PR) were necessary for both groups. Unlike retailers, farmers were also motivated by hedonic motivation (HM) from using the platform. Explicitly, retailers’ behavioral intentions were influenced by a more significant number of factors than those of farmers. This research suggests that policymakers should develop targeted marketing campaigns leveraging social influence for retailers, improve platform usability and security, and create incentives for habitual use to enhance platform adoption. Additionally, policymakers should promote engaging features for farmers, provide comprehensive education and training, and advocate for supportive policies and financial incentives. Strategic actions to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy will improve the environmental sustainability and economic resilience of the agri-food sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agricultural waste; circular economy; digital technology; food waste; modified UTAUT2","economic conditions; food waste; innovation; policy making; waste management"

Thus, the main aim of this study is to investigate the social acceptance level of the two systems and the implementation preferences of Egyptian end users, i.e., residents, in relation to their different sociocultural backgrounds. Given that most of the construction in Egypt is taking place in new cities, the acceptance of such systems strongly relates to societal implications for urban sustainability. An online survey was therefore disseminated to the residents of new cities in the Greater Cairo Region in Egypt (n = 274). A contingency analysis was conducted using the SPSS tool, calculating the Chi-squared and Fisher tests to identify significant associations between the variables. Results indicated a high level of social acceptance of both the agricultural (71 %) and solar energy (64 %) systems. The attitude of residents towards the systems and their experience using them were the variables exhibiting the highest association with social acceptance of agricultural systems (p < 0.001 for attitude and experience) and solar energy systems (p = 0.04 for attitude and p = 0.002 for experience). The most preferred system types were the horizontal planters on hand railings and roof-mounted photovoltaics. Responses showed that production was the main aim for agricultural systems, while economic returns were the main aim for solar systems. However, both systems faced the same barriers, especially in relation to economic barriers. Out of the 12 sociocultural variables tested, respondents’ age had the most significant impact on the implementation preferences of both systems followed by gender, residence type, and access to shared facilities. Our study addressed a knowledge gap by comparing the two systems to identify the common or different reasons behind the disparity between their high theoretical potential versus low on-ground implementation. Future research could investigate other underlying factors behind social acceptance beyond the analyzed sociocultural aspects and tackle the types of each system in detail. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Egypt; Implementation preferences; Solar energy generation; Sustainable buildings; Technology acceptance; Urban agriculture","Agriculture; Intelligent buildings; Social aspects; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Egypt; End-users; Energy generations; Implementation preference; Social acceptance; Solar energy generation; Solar energy systems; Sustainable building; Technology acceptance; Urban agricultures; Solar energy; building; preference behavior; solar power; sustainability; urban agriculture; urban society; urbanization; Cairo [Cairo (GVR)]; Cairo [Egypt]"

Given this context, policymakers have been encouraged to draw on complexity science-informed approaches in policymaking to help grapple with and manage the mounting complexity of the world. For nearly eighty years, complexity-informed approaches have been promising to change how our complex systems are understood and managed, ultimately assisting in better policymaking. Despite the potential of complexity science, in practice, its use often remains limited to a few specialised domains and has not become part and parcel of the mainstream policy debate. To understand why this might be the case, we question why complexity science remains nascent and not integrated into the core of policymaking. Specifically, we ask what the non-technical challenges and barriers are preventing the adoption of complexity science into policymaking. To address this question, we conducted an extensive literature review. We collected the scattered fragments of text that discussed the non-technical challenges related to the use of complexity science in policymaking and stitched these fragments into a structured framework by synthesising our findings. Our framework consists of three thematic groupings of the non-technical challenges: (a) management, cost, and adoption challenges; (b) limited trust, communication, and acceptance; and (c) ethical barriers. For each broad challenge identified, we propose a mitigation strategy to facilitate the adoption of complexity science into policymaking.

The carsharing adoption behaviors are classified into five stages using the transtheoretical model: precontemplation (PC), contemplation (C), preparation (PA), action (A), and maintenance (M). In Beijing, a comprehensive survey combining stated preference and revealed preference methods is conducted to collect data on travelers' adoption attitudes and related attributes, such as socioeconomic characteristics, travel features, and carsharing usage environments. Specifically, ten latent attitudinal variables are derived from the technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior. An integrated choice and latent variable model is developed to examine the impact of these explanatory factors on the transition processes between the five adoption stages. The findings reveal that the effects of explanatory factors on stage transitions in carsharing adoption behaviors differ across stages. Factors such as education level, income, having children, car ownership, familiarity with carsharing, personal condition, and social pressures play a crucial role in the early stages of understanding before carsharing adoption, namely the PC-C and C-PA stage transitions. Conversely, in the later stages (PA-A and A-M), travelers show a greater emphasis on carsharing infrastructure, including station reachability, vehicle availability, and perception toward rental stations and shared vehicles. Additionally, factors related to travel habits and expectations are influential throughout all stages of the carsharing adoption process. Lastly, three categories of measures, namely soft, neutral, and hard measures, are derived from the results to guide policymakers and carsharing operators in formulating strategies for the operation and management of carsharing systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudinal factors; Behavior change; Carsharing; Choice behavior; Stage transition; Transtheoretical model",""

The result demonstrated that the easier a tool was to use, the less value leaners seemed to see in it for their learning process. It can be implied that as Generative-AI get more intuitive, learners think they're less helpful. These finding challenges a few of those assumptions we usually make within the TAM model. It also points out the characteristic of learners which affects their learning preferences and expectation. Another finding showed the impact of language barrier on non-native English speaker that obstruct the user experience in AI services. Moreover, the role of universities in fostering both AI integration for learning for and the ethical implementation of Generative AI. By providing a supportive environment that encourages AI experimentation, redesign learning, empowering learners and faculty instructors to investigate how Generative AI can be applied across disciplines, and developing guidelines for ethical use, universities play a critical role in shaping the effective and responsible integration of AI into the next educational landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence in education; Educational technology; Generative-AI; SEM research; Student perceptions; Technology Acceptance Model",""

E-commerce technology enables the distribution of imperfect organic produce from farmers to potential customers, mitigating agri-food waste issues. Green consumers are prospective customers of imperfect produce because their purchasing decisions are made based on sustainability and environmental considerations. However, each individual’s degree of green consumption differs, impacting their preferences and behaviors toward green buying activity. Considering the gap between the varying levels of green consumers and their intention to purchase imperfect organic produce through e-commerce, this study aimed to profile three distinct green consumers and explore factors affecting their Online Green Purchase Intention (OGPI) for imperfect organic vegetables. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was applied in this study, and Web-Based Label Quality (WLQ) was introduced as an extended construct to describe green consumers’ perceptions of the credibility and reliability of labels or product-related information displayed on e-commerce platforms. This study involved 668 internet users from environmental platforms and online communities of organic food enthusiasts. First, the consumers were classified into dark-green, semi/light green, and non-green using a cluster analysis approach. Then, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Multi-Group Analysis (MGA) were employed to determine the factors affecting OGPI among green consumer groups. This research found that Performance Expectancy (PE), Social Influence (SI), and WLQ positively influenced dark-green consumers’ online green purchase intention. Only Performance Expectancy (PE) positively affected semi/light-green consumers’ OGPI. Meanwhile, the Facilitating Condition (FC) positively affected non-green consumers’ online green purchase intentions. This research revealed dark-green consumers as the target segment, broadening customers’ perspectives on accepting imperfect organic products, including e-commerce technology. Moreover, the research results can be utilized for marketing and business purposes and contribute to food policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","consumer segmentation; e-commerce; extended UTAUT; green consumers; imperfect produce; online green purchase intention; shades of green",""

In this study an online survey was distributed among members of environmental, non-governmental, professional, and academic organizations to assess the acceptability of forestry practices in Puerto Rico among members of civic society interested in environmental management issues. Participants were asked about their perception of forest uses, their preference of tree harvesting technologies, methods that may apply in small scale wood production settings, and trust in organizations providing forest information. We also inquired about attitudes towards economic activity in forests and the impact of such activity on recreation and biodiversity. The results show that even though participants do not place a high priority on economic development through forestry activities, acceptance of forest management for wood harvesting will be possible by considering adherence to particular forestry technologies and methods to safeguard current recreation activities and biodiversity conservation. Social acceptability information would be worthwhile when seeking consensus among a broader group of local stakeholders. As a next step we suggest the creation of a council constituted by diverse forestry sector stakeholders that would engage in a strategic planning exercise to delineate a clear road map that can guide short and long-term sustainable forest management, including wood industry development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Caribbean; Ecosystem services; Public perception; Stakeholders; Sustainable forestry; Wood industry","Biodiversity; Conservation; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Timber; Caribbean; Ecosystem services; Environmental professionals; Forestry practices; Public perception; Puerto Rico; Social acceptability; Stakeholder; Sustainable forestry; Wood industry; Forestry; academic research; biodiversity; economic activity; economic development; ecosystem service; environmental technology; forest management; forestry; perception; public attitude; stakeholder; sustainable forestry; timber industry; academia; article; consensus; conservation biology; environmental management; exercise; forest; human; recreation; social acceptance; strategic planning; tree; wood; environmental protection; procedures; Caribbean Islands; Academia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Humans; Trees"

Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, representing energy-efficient advancements in aviation that are pivotal to advanced air mobility (AAM), have garnered attention. Yet, the discourse on eVTOLs’ role in tourism remains scant. This study, drawing from 450 samples in the Mogan Mountain Scenic Area, introduces the AAM-tourism acceptance model (ATAM). It integrates the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM) theoretical frameworks, incorporating environmental consciousness, perceived safety, hedonic motivation, and personal innovativeness, assessing their influence on tourists’ eVTOL usage intention through a structural equation model (SEM). The results reveal that environmental consciousness significantly impacts hedonic motivation and perceived usefulness, driving eVTOL adoption. Furthermore, personal innovativeness influences intention through hedonic motivation and perceived behavioral control. Therefore, environmental consciousness and hedonic motivation align deeply with eVTOL attributes, both significantly positively influencing intention to use. Thus, the study validates eVTOL’s viability in tourism and its potential for sectoral expansion. Moreover, it offers insights into how psychological factors shape eVTOL adoption, guiding the promotion of eVTOL sightseeing services and informing research on AAM acceptance across various domains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","advanced air mobility; ATAM; electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft; environmental consciousness; structural equation model; technology acceptance model; theory of planned behavior; tourism","aircraft; exploration; hedonic analysis; numerical model; perception; psychology; social mobility; sustainable development; tourism management; tourist destination"

Digital transformation raises key questions about teachers’ digital competence. Building on the DigCompEdu framework, the current study aims to uncover the level of digital competence of science teachers and their perceptions towards it as well as to identify the factors influencing this competence. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach utilizing a sequential explanatory design. This design involved a questionnaire which was administered to a sample of 611 science teachers, while a semi-structured interview was applied to 13 teachers. The results indicate that the teachers’ level of digital competence was medium (58.4%). The study also revealed that the teachers had high-level positive perceptions towards the use of digital technologies (78%). Furthermore, the results indicate that perceived usefulness and subjective norms directly influence digital competence. This study also identifies the benefits of digital technologies and the challenges that teachers encounter in implementing them in the educational environment. The benefits focus on enhancing students’ motivation and assessing their learning experiences, communicating with the educational community, and the continuousness of e-learning. The challenges, however, include the acceptance of technology by the educational community; cognitive and skill-related challenges faced by teachers; administrative and teaching burdens; limited access to digital technologies and tools; and challenges related to student behaviors.

The impact of AVs depends ultimately on how the technology will be adopted, e.g. privately or shared AVs (SAVs), and integrated into the socio-technical mobility system. In this study, we evaluate how social considerations and the AV technology may enhance new social arrangements for travel, especially for groups suffering from some disadvantages in accessing transport. Particularly, we explore a proposed new form of social arrangement, coined “Travel Community” (TC), to create shared AVs trips based on individual preferences. An online national representative sample in Israel was conducted (N = 1009). The data was analyzed using multivariate methods including multinomial logistic regression models for the willingness to adopt TC in two contexts: commuting (TCC) and travel leisure (TCL). The findings suggest that TC was well accepted by the participants under certain assumptions and could address latent demand for improving travel options for people with different constraints accessing transport, such as women, young, sporadic travelers, and low-income individuals. The personal social preferences option might help overcome psychological barriers regarding shared mobility, such as the fear of sharing the trip with strangers and a social value promoting a new kind of social interaction. Planners and stakeholders should consider social considerations' relevance (opportunities and risks) for promoting and creating new forms of mobility and improving urban sustainability and social inclusion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Vehicles; Change of travel habits; Mobility innovation; Social acceptance; Social inclusion",""

Notably, the UK government published its Hydrogen Strategy in August 2021 to support decarbonisation targets and energy security ambitions. While establishing techno-economic feasibility for hydrogen energy systems is a prerequisite of the prospective transition, social acceptability is also needed to support visions for the ‘hydrogen economy’. However, to date, societal factors are yet to be embedded into policy prescriptions. Securing social acceptance is especially critical in the context of ‘hydrogen homes’, which entails replacing natural gas boilers and hobs with low-carbon hydrogen appliances. Reflecting the nascency of hydrogen heating and cooking technologies, the dynamics of social acceptance are yet to be explored in a comprehensive way. Similarly, public perceptions of the hydrogen economy and emerging national strategies remain poorly understood. Given the paucity of conceptual and empirical insights, this study develops an integrated acceptance framework and tests its predictive power using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Results highlight the importance of risk perceptions, trust dynamics, and emotions in shaping consumer perceptions. Foremost, prospects for deploying hydrogen homes at scale may rest with coupling renewable-based hydrogen production to local environmental and socio-economic benefits.

Due to the global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, higher education institutions are now increasingly emphasising online interactive learning. Higher education institutions are currently investigating the potential of metaverse technology to enhance student learning by immersing them in a 3D interactive environment. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of research on how Gen Z in developing Arab nations, such as Jordan, decide whether or not to use metaverse technology in higher education (Eduverse). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of Eduverse adoption to encourage and inspire Gen Z students to make use of this cutting-edge technology. Through structural equation modeling applied to a sample of 537 Jordanian students of Gen Z, this research assessed a model that adapts and integrates the UTUAT2 theory with Personnel Innovativeness in IT (PIIT). From a UTAUT2 perspective, the results suggest that, apart from social influence, all other included determinants have significant and positive impacts on Gen Z adoption intentions for the metaverse in higher education learning environments. In addition, the results demonstrate that PIIT is a strong predictor of adoption intention both directly and indirectly via performance and effort expectations. The developed model in this study explains 57.5% of the variance in Eduverse adoption intentions. This study adds to the current body of knowledge by enhancing our comprehension of the dynamics and behaviours of Eduverse acceptance among Jordanian Gen Z students. In addition to its theoretical value, this research offers profound implications for the executives and policymakers of higher education institutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Educational Technology; Higher Education; Metaverse; Personal Innovativeness in IT; PIIT; UTAUT2",""

This dual-component system is not solely a cutting-edge piece of smart furniture centered on hardware; it also encompasses a specially designed web application to engage the citizens of Balaguer. Together, they form a comprehensive infrastructure aimed at enhancing environmental awareness and promoting civic participation. This kiosk is a dynamic platform for displaying real-time data from sensors across the city, facilitating interactive questionnaires, and providing essential information about the city and town hall. The application of this technology directly contributes to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by fostering public awareness and participation in critical issues such as climate action, health and well-being, gender equality, innovation in infrastructure, and reducing inequalities. Specifically, the interactive totem allows for the collection and analysis of data regarding citizens’ perceptions of their living conditions, environmental impact, and social inequalities. This practical application of our work exemplifies how technological innovation can be leveraged to enhance civic engagement, support sustainable development, and foster a more informed and participatory urban community. The concept of a smart city is becoming increasingly popular to improve citizens’ quality of life. Institutions are also committed to enhancing the sustainability of cities by implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper presents a Balaguer case study investigating energy demand monitoring, decreasing energy demand, and citizen acceptance in a municipality district. The study collected data from three sources: (1) quantitative data coming from on-site sensors; (2) quantitative data from a simulation of the area; and (3) qualitative data from questionnaires developed with a totem located in the city center. This study shows the importance of citizen science in contributing towards the increased awareness of energy demand, renewable energy, and climate change. But it also shows how citizen science can improve research quality involving the municipality authorities. This study also was instrumental in contributing to the increase in awareness among municipality authorities and capacity building on the topic. This activity may also contribute towards the implementation of actions to reduce the energy demand in public buildings and helping them in deploying policies to decrease energy demand in buildings, increase the use of renewable energy, and increase awareness among citizens. The government will use the information gathered to develop policies for citizen improvement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","building energy simulation; citizen science; e-government; public awareness; SDG; smart city",""

ART systems are designed to utilize hydrogen energy, serving as an efficient and eco-friendly power source. This not only addresses issues related to traffic congestion but also presents a promising solution to environmental challenges. However, the success of implementing such technologies to mitigate these challenges relies heavily on the support and acceptance of potential users. This study aims to explore the intention of users to adopt ART as a mode of transportation in the context of Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia. This study conducted a comprehensive survey involving 350 respondents and employed Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. The findings of this study reveal that several critical factors significantly influence the behavioural intention to use ART for commuting. Specifically, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and individual attitudes have a significant impact on the intention to embrace ART as a sustainable mode of transportation. However, the study also finds that personal norms do not exhibit a significant relationship with behavioural intention. This insight underscores the pivotal role of societal influences compared to individually internalized values in shaping user decision-making with regard to the adoption of ART for commuting. It is imperative for policymakers to take into account the perspectives and considerations of users when formulating policies related to the introduction and promotion of new public transportation modes where private transportation has traditionally been prevalent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Rapid Transit; green transport; personal norm; subjective norm; sustainability",""

This study aimed to investigate user acceptance of a smart home voice assistant. A questionnaire was designed, and 471 Chinese adults were recruited to complete the questionnaire. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis. The results revealed that user requirements of adults were composed of six factors: hedonic motivation and trust (β =.41, p <.001), social influence (β =.22, p <.001), performance expectancy (β =.15, p <.001), effort expectancy (β =.08, p =.018), product features (β =.15, p =.009), and facilitating conditions (β =.06, p =.049). Among these six factors, hedonic motivation and trust are considered the most important. Younger, middle-aged, and older adults differed significantly in their requirements and acceptance of a smart home voice assistant. These findings have implications for the design of smart home voice assistants so that they are more acceptable to younger and older adults. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Internet of things (IoT); Older adults; Smart home voice assistant; Technology acceptance; UTAUT","Automation; Factor analysis; Motivation; Regression analysis; Surveys; Factors analysis; Hedonic motivations; Home environment; Internet of thing; Older adults; Smart home voice assistant; Smart homes; Technology acceptance; Users' acceptance; UTAUT; Internet of things"

Digital twins of customer demands promise to remedy these issues. However, successful implementation necessitates users' technology acceptance. This study contrasts three hierarchical digital twin levels with different degrees of user integration and examines determinants for their respective acceptance. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation model is applied in a comparative manner, considering different levels of digital twin radicalness. A multidimensional approach is used to measure attitudes towards usage. Data are collected in the context of organisational supply management. Findings: Results show harmonious effects across digital twin levels. This indicates that technological radicality plays only a subordinate role when assessing acceptance determinants such as user perception on ease of use, usefulness, trust and risk. Practical implications: Rather than focussing solely on technological factors, findings suggest that users prioritise the actual outcome and efficiency of the system. This perspective offers practical implications for organisations seeking to implement advanced systems and emphasises the significance of user perceptions beyond technological features. Social implications: The societal impact of this research are an appreciation of customer roles in the supply chain where an enhanced detection of customer needs and preferences aligns businesses with the dynamic and evolving demands of a diverse and a continuously environmentally-conscious consumer base. Originality/value: This study applies a measurement model for technology acceptance in a unique and multidimensional manner. Thereby, a comparative analysis of user perceptions across different digital twin levels sheds more light on a nascent, promising and underexplored technological method.

Thus, the study aims to examine users'’ experiences with the JouleBug app, which is designed to encourage users to complete at least one daily green task. Design/methodology/approach: After a trial period of two weeks, a total of 360 participants completed the post-game survey during the research process. Findings: The findings from the structural equation modeling and data analysis indicated a good fit for the model. The findings demonstrate that usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment of eco-gamification enrich users' sustainability knowledge, which, in turn, strongly influences their pro-sustainable intentions. According to the findings, the three factors of TPB have a significant impact on users' pro-sustainability intentions. Both sustainable knowledge and social cues play mediating roles in such relationships. Practical implications: This study advocates that eco-gamification can be used as a platform to modify tourists’ pro-sustainability intentions in emerging tourism and technology destinations such as Egypt. Hence, this study offers significant information to tourism planners and other stakeholders on tourists’ behavioural intentions.

Vertical agriculture is one potential strategy to contribute to food system resilience. To date, the literature exploring this technology has focused on consumer perceptions, with less examination of broader social-ecological system considerations or on-the-ground implications for vulnerable food system actors. This study explores local food system stakeholders’ account of vertical agriculture’s potential contributions to food system resilience, and specifically to food system decentralization, increasing stakeholder decision-making autonomy and diversifying food systems. The results of an exploratory focus group with 16 participants, including local government officials and members of community food organizations, are presented. Participants discussed how vertical agriculture can contribute to food system decentralization by operating across a variety of scales and in public institutions, although local land-use zoning barriers, competing land use priorities, and lack of community acceptance may hinder its widespread implementation. Further, vertical agriculture may contribute to food system diversification by increasing the amount of regionally available produce in the face of future supply disruptions. The potential implications of vertical agriculture for increasing decision-making autonomy will vary, depending on whether it is governed at more or less accessible scales and forms. It is recommended that further research consider diverse scenarios and engage with wider stakeholder and community groups for vertical agriculture’s planning and implementation, particularly in less explored land use contexts, such as in agricultural regions or in public institutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency; Food systems; Local food; Regional food; Resilience; Vertical agriculture","agriculture; autonomy; decision making; local government; stakeholder; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser Valley"

In existing research, travel demand prediction for traffic bottlenecks is based on travel behavior assumptions, and prediction accuracy is low in practice. Thus, the effect of traffic bottleneck management strategies cannot be guaranteed. Management strategies are often mandatory, leading to problems such as unfairness and low social acceptance. To address such issues, this paper proposes managing traffic bottlenecks based on shared travel plans. To solve the information security and privacy problems caused by travel plan sharing and achieve information transparency, travel plans are shared and regulated by blockchain technology. To optimize the operation level of traffic bottlenecks, travel plan regulation models under scenarios where all/some travelers share travel plans are proposed and formulated as linear programming models, and these models are integrated into the blockchain with smart contract technology. Furthermore, travel plan regulation models are tested and verified using traffic flow data from the Su-Tong Yangtze River Highway Bridge, China. The results indicate that the proposed travel plan regulation models are effective for alleviating traffic congestion. The vehicle transfer rate and total delay rate increase as the degree of total demand increases; the vehicle transfer rate increases as the length of the time interval decreases; and the vehicle transfer rate and total delay rate increase as the number of vehicles not sharing their travel plans increases. By using the model and method proposed in this paper, the sustainability of urban economy, society, and environment can be promoted. However, there are many practical situations that have not been considered in this paper, such as multiple entry and exit bottlenecks, multiple travel modes, and other control strategies. In addition, this paper considers only one bottleneck rather than road networks because of the throughput limitations of blockchain technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; congestion management; optimization model; traffic bottleneck; travel demand","management practice; optimization; sustainability; traffic congestion; traffic management; travel behavior; travel demand; China; Yangtze River"

While the deployment of low-carbon hydrogen energy systems remains nascent and is subject to a range of techno-economic constraints, potential scalability will also hinge on social acceptance. In response, this study draws on extensive national survey data to derive a comprehensive typology of domestic acceptance, which reflects multiple factors influencing consumer attitudes towards low-carbon hydrogen heating and cooking appliances. The proposed typology is developed through rigorous coding of over 1000 qualitative statements, leading to 12 core acceptance factors composed of a mix of positive, neutral, and negative sub-factors. The study finds that eight primary sub-factors account for close to 60 % of identified codes, with knowledge deficit (negative), environmental benefits (positive), and financial risks (negative) ranking highest. Critically, these three sub-factors are also the most statistically significant predictors of consumer heterogeneity. At the sub-group level, the analysis shows that engagement with renewable energy technology and climate change is associated with stronger perceptions of environmental benefits and lower financial concerns. By contrast, perceived financial risks and concerns over energy injustice constrain acceptance levels among fuel stressed respondents. Through mixed-methods analysis, the study transmits the value of advancing acceptance typologies as a critical mechanism for enacting a ‘just’ hydrogen economy. The analysis supports developing strategic measures which account for consumer heterogeneity to better support socially acceptable pathways for residential decarbonisation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic hydrogen; Energy justice; Social acceptance; Technology adoption; Thematic analysis; Typology development",""

The V2G technology allows energy systems to balance renewable energy, thus contributing to climate change alleviation. Employing a self-report online survey among Norwegian car users (n = 929) in November 2021, the study aims to investigate how perceptions and beliefs towards the V2G system motivate both EV users and non-EV users (combustion engine car owners as potential future EV users) to utilise the V2G technology in the future. Understanding similarities and dissimilarities in future intentions of V2G use across two groups of car users (i.e., EV and non-EV users) may facilitate segment-specific marketing. The core theoretical framework in the study is a hypothesised model based on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Reasoned Action. The results show that the theoretical framework substantially explains future V2G use intentions. The model showed that behavioural beliefs related to the use of V2G technology and varying concerns and benefits about this system (e.g., concern over vehicle battery, usefulness in terms of financial and environmental benefits) explain V2G adoption among the groups. A multiple-group structural equation model showed structural stability in associations between the model constructs and intention across EV and non-EV users. However, non-EV users had lower means on central variables (i.e., trust in V2G, perceived ease of use, vehicle battery concern, perceived usefulness, subjective norm, and intention). In accordance with the postulated social cognitive theoretical framework, the study concludes that both groups of car users have a significant belief-behavioural intention to participate in V2G technology. When it comes to behavioural change campaigns, the same measures could be taken into account for both groups of car users. Non-EV users, however, should receive more attention in such campaigns. To promote V2G adoption among car users, particularly among non-EV users, a multifaceted policy approach is needed. This should include financial incentives like tax credits, educational campaigns highlighting EV benefits with V2G contracts, expanding EV charging infrastructure, and developing a public-private V2G infrastructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric vehicles; Electricity management; Energy policy; Multiple-group structural equation model; Technology acceptance model; Transport policy","Climate change; Electric vehicles; Environmental technology; Secondary batteries; Taxation; Vehicle-to-grid; Electricity management; Multiple-group; Multiple-group structural equation model; Structural equation models; Technology acceptance model; Theoretical framework; Transport policy; Vehicle battery; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle users; Stability; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy policy; survey method; technological development; transportation policy; Norway"

This process leads to a significantly greater number of care workers that will be needed in the future. Concurrently, the demands on caregivers concerning the amount of care and quality of care are increasing. Socially-assistive robots (SARs) are a promising resource in this regard. At the same time, research that directly addresses the target group of elderly persons with cognitive impairments is underrepresented. This study reports observations regarding the interaction between a SAR and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Seven observational and behavioural measures were conducted during the interaction between residents of a nursing home and the SAR named “James”. Twelve participants from two residential homes took part in the study. Data were analysed by using content analysis and interpreted along a technology acceptance model. Verbal comments and observable emotions of the SAR were predominantly positive, only a few participants reacted negatively to the SAR “James”. There was also hardly any shyness to touch the robot. The participants made eye contact and responded adequately to the robot’s requests. Tasks which were set by the SAR in group settings led to a higher communication between the participants than tasks in single-user settings. The mainly upbeat emotions and interaction with the SAR indicates a positive attitude towards the system.

Moreover, the adoption of tools that students already use in their everyday lives facilitates the integration of new forms of learning. In this context, we have developed an initiative to disseminate content through TikTok in three modules of the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing course, with the aim of promoting quality learning through these microlearning environments. To this end, we have implemented these learning environments and evaluated the users’ perceptions, as well as their level of acceptance of the technology according to the Technology Acceptance Model. Overall, our results show high levels of satisfaction with regard to engagement and the content generated, as well as in terms of the acceptance of the technology. Our results do not show gender-specific variations, but we did detect slight variations depending on the subject in which the microlearning tool was deployed. Although for the most part these variations do not change the participants' assessment of their experience, it will be necessary in the future to determine the underlying reasons for these variations. In addition, our results suggest that it is possible to design a content creation system to promote quality learning through microlearning that can be transferred to other subjects, at least in the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital learning technologies; e-learning; microlearning; social media; technology acceptance; TikTok",""

The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) has emerged as a significant invention in aiding drivers in preventing accidents. This technology is gradually being integrated into newly built automobiles. This study examined and developed a model for the acceptance of ADAS systems among young people in TARUMT, considering external factors, based on the literature review and technology acceptance extension models such as TAM and UTAUT. Additional elements that will influence the acceptance of the ADAS system among young individuals are also considered. To verify the model, we employ PSPP to determine the Pearson’s Correlation for each element. This study reveals that various factors, including Social Norm, Trust rank, enjoyment, attitude, and Perceived Usefulness, exhibit a significant correlation with Behavioral Intention. Additionally, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Safety Risk, Privacy Risk, Individual Innovation, Environmental Protection, and Symbolic Value demonstrate a significant correlation with Attitude. Furthermore, Reliability exerts significant influence on Perceived Usefulness, Enjoyment is significantly related to Perceived Ease of Use, and Perceived Ease of Use exhibits significant correlation with Perceived Usefulness. We employed an online questionnaire developed using Google Form for data collection and distributed a link to friends who are also studying at TARUMT. 162 sets of answers was gathered. The proposed model offers enhanced survey models and assistance to car manufacturers in gaining insights into the acceptance of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) among young individuals in TARUMT. This information can be utilised to determine areas for improvement in the research and development of ADAS systems. Additionally, it can serve as a valuable reference for the government in formulating more effective policies pertaining to ADAS systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance consumer behaviour; Advanced Drivers Assistance System (ADAS); Factors; Youngsters",""

It incorporated eight dimensions derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models and involved validating a research tool consisting of 32 items. Design/methodology/approach: Blended learning (BL) in higher education (HE) not only makes education more flexible and accessible but also enhances the overall quality of learning through diverse methods, preparing students for future digital work environments (Zhang et al., 2022). This study aimed to evaluate Algerian students' acceptance of BL. It incorporated eight dimensions derived from the TAM and UTAUT models and involved validating a research tool consisting of 32 items. The final implementation was conducted with 549 undergraduate and master’s students aged between 19 and 33. The results indicated that performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions (FC) had a positive direct effect on behavioral intentions (BI). Moreover, BI positively affected actual acceptance (AA). Additionally, there were positive and significant indirect effects of FC on AA through the mediating variables perceived usefulness (PU), social influence (SI) on AA through BI and perceived ease of use (PEU) on AA through PU. However, EE had no significant indirect effect on AA through PU. Furthermore, gender was a significant moderating variable between SI and AA. There was no significant effect of students' residence on the relationships between PEU and PU and PEU and BI. The study offers valuable insights into educational practices and policies, concluding with practical recommendations to enhance the academic environment, informed by these study outcomes. Findings: This study finds that the students' place of residence did not significantly moderate the relationships involving PEU. This suggests a uniform perception of BL’s ease of use among students, irrespective of their residential backgrounds. This uniformity is essential for the implementation of BL across diverse regions in Algeria, indicating that a one-size-fits-all approach to BL design might be effective. Originality/value: Researchers measured the contribution of PU, PEU, PE, EE, SI, FC, BI, AA to know the direct and indirect effects among them, as well as the research populations.

In the second stage, the designed gamification solution developed in Unity AR was assessed to measure its acceptability and environmental effects. Findings: This study aimed to investigate mobile AR learning experiences. The researchers designed an AR-based game for general chemistry learning, to investigate its effects on students’ behavior, satisfaction and attention. In addition, it intended to uncover the challenges they faced, their experience, concerns about using and the time spent interacting with AR. This study showed that a postlecture activity of testing with AR games affected the retention of lecture contents over 12 weeks significantly better than the retention of the material taught by traditional teaching methodology. Thus, AR-G technology helped to lower students’ test anxiety and increased the regularity of studying. In this study, a student learned in the environment and was liberated from corporeal and sensory connections with their physical surroundings, which greatly aided in improving their experience and collecting players’ learnability analytics, experience, motivation and well-being via game analytics. However, AR-G technology established a competitive learning environment to increase learning by allowing students to be more involved in the learning process and therefore more motivated, resulting in greater real-world performance. On the other hand, that agrees with the latest studies in neuroeducation indicating that it is difficult to learn without conscious and sustained attention. Noreikis et al. (2019) confirmed in their research that action video games could greatly enhance perceptual ability and improve concentration, resulting in a positive impact on learning effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: The study has difficulties such as certain hardware being incompatible with the systems of the user device, such as HMD with mobile, and incompatible games. Although AR is not a new technology, one of its challenges is that instructors and students may not be comfortable using it and may not be convinced of the usefulness of technology. One drawback of the current study was that it was limited to a single first-year chemistry class. If the study had been done across several lengthy semesters, it could have had a more beneficial outcome. Another challenge was the small number of participants of students, and their withdrawal for unexpected medical conditions or psychological distress. The choice of one gaming session in a week could generate biased results. Practical implications: This study explores how AR with gamification technology can support learning general chemistry topics and shows that AR improved academic achievement and provided instant feedback. The results indicate that AR technology could be helpful in an academic setting by increasing academic achievement and raising motivation for the students who used AR-G technology. Social implications: 50% of the interviewees had positive learning experience of AR referring to AR as an enjoyable learning value they gained. One participant commented that “I believe that the augmented reality would be better compared to long texts, and may be suitable for young learners and I feel it is quite efficient and effective”. More than half of the interviewees too considered augmented reality motivating them, triggering their ambition to search for answers to the questions and enhancing further motivated classroom learning. Two interviewees argued that AR potentially develops fun experiences but not necessarily improve learning. Originality/value: To meet the objective, 3D interactive story game that imitates the classroom and the laboratory environment in an ecofriendly, entertaining and exciting manner was designed for students of a chemistry course. The first classroom chemistry syllabus was overall divided into three learning units based on their increasing level of difficulty. For each learning unit, the proposed game will offer three modes of green-driven AR-G smart learning. To keep the target students motivated in order to undertake the gaming activity on a regular basis, various motivational affordances will be systematically embedded within the proposed game strategy that includes points, leaderboards, achievements, badges, levels, story, theme, feedback, clear goals, day-to-day challenges and rewards (Deterding et al. (2011), Stott and Neustaedter (2013). Finally, the designed gamification solution was developed in Unity AR, which was later preliminarily tested to evaluate its acceptability and impact on environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academic achievement; Augmented reality with gamification; Chemistry concepts; Engagement; Learnability; Learning environment; Motivation; Technology acceptance model; Virtual learning environment",""

Two critical factors in the Islamic educational context that are scarcely addressed in the literature are perceived educational compatibility (PIC) and digital self-efficacy (DSE). Therefore, the study aspires to address the existing gaps by examining the determinants of intention to accept DT in Islamic education by integrating a contextual factor into TAM. We used a quantitative survey to acquire data from Islamic university students in Brunei, and a sample of 160 cases was obtained through Google Forms. Using the SEM-PLS (structural-equation-modelling-partial least squares) approach, the data was analysed through the ADANCO software to test the study’s seven hypotheses. The results were that all hypotheses were significantly supported, including the significant effects of both DSE and PIC, besides two TAM’s core variables, on learners’ intention to utilise digital technology for learning purposes.

However, in addition to advanced technology, successful implementation of these systems requires broad public willingness to use them. This paper presents the results of a three-phase psychosocial intervention with the users of a business building where a decentralized wastewater treatment plant was installed. The intervention, motivated by complaints from users due to their lack of knowledge about the existence of the plant, aimed at understanding and improving users’ perceptions of the building’s decentralized system. In the first phase, we conducted a focus group with a sample of workers (n = 6) to understand their knowledge and perception of the building’s decentralized wastewater treatment system. Once the main obstacles and facilitators were identified, we designed a second phase where a group of employees (n = 46) were exposed to environmental priming to improve attitudes toward the decentralized plant installed in the building. Finally, in the third phase, a bidirectional informative session was proposed, conducted by experts, to another group of workers (n = 25). Findings suggest that implementing specific psychosocial strategies, such as promoting environmental awareness and providing informative sessions, along with incorporating potential users throughout the process, contributes to better acceptance of the decentralized wastewater treatment plant. This work presents a real case in a pilot plant that can serve as a guide for addressing psychosocial resistance in similar projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceptance; attitudes; decentralized wastewater treatment systems; priming; psychosocial intervention; social perception",""

The adoption of sustainable practices relies on producers’ acceptance and increased integration on their operations. In this study, we applied the Theory of Diffusion of Innovations and social marketing framework to assess cattle producers’ outcome perceptions, adoption status, and perceived benefits and barriers toward adopting sustainable practices to inform communication campaigns promoting holistic sustainability. An intercept survey was distributed to producers attending a national cattle convention to gain quantitative data. Results indicated producers have the highest intent to adopt practices focused on supporting the local economy, maintaining the overall welfare of cattle, and preserving ranching culture. Additionally, producers viewed protecting water quality, protecting the welfare of cattle, and maintaining healthy ecosystems as the top benefits to adopting sustainable practices on their operation; whereas, financial concerns and risks, changes to equipment and technology, and perceptions of inefficacy were viewed as barriers toward implementation. Communication to cattle producers should focus on how adoption can elevate their perceived benefits and minimize reported barriers. Additional research should focus on continued approaches to understand the types of information cattle producers need to further explain communication strategy in this area by qualitative approaches and message testing. Furthermore, implementing social marketing in the classroom is recommended to equip students with techniques that identify a target audience’s barriers and benefits to inform effective communication campaigns that promote long-lasting behavior change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barriers; Behavior Change; Benefits; Diffusion of Innovations; Social Marketing; Sustainability",""

Background AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students - the primary target demographic – and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool’s userfriendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an as- sessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendations for Researchers The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students’ perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students’ acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention.

Background After the COVID-19 pandemic, many high schools reopened for in-person classes, which led to a decreased reliance on e-learning. The shift from online to traditional face-to-face learning has influenced students’ perceptions of the importance of e-learning in their academic activities. Consequently, high schools are facing the challenge of ensuring that LMS can still be integrated into the teaching-learning process even after the pandemic ends. Therefore, this study proposes a model to investigate the factors that affect students’ actual use of LMS in the high school environment. Methodology This study used 890 high school students to validate the theoretical model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis to deliver direct, indirect, and moderating effect analysis. Contribution This study combines SOR and acceptance theory to provide a model to explain high school students’ intention to use technology. The involvement of direct, indirect, and moderating effects analysis offers an alternative result and discussion and is considered another contribution of this study from a technical perspective. Findings The findings show that perceived satisfaction is the most influential factor affecting the use of LMS, followed by perceived usefulness. Meanwhile, from indirect effect analysis, subjective norms and computer self-efficacy were found to indirectly affect actual use through perceived usefulness as a mediator. Content quality was also an indirect predictor of the actual use of LMS through perceived satisfaction. Further, the moderating effect of age influenced perceived satisfaction’s direct effect on actual use. Recommendations This study provides practical recommendations that can be useful to high for Practitioners schools and other stakeholders in improving the use of LMS in educational environments. Specifically, exploring the implementation of LMS in high schools prior to and following the COVID-19 outbreak can offer valuable insights into the changing educational environment. Recommendations The results of this study present a significant theoretical contribution by em-for Researchers ploying a comprehensive approach to explain the adoption of LMS among high school students after the COVID-19 pandemic. This contribution extends the GETAMEL framework by incorporating environmental, personal, and learning quality aspects while also analyzing both direct and indirect effects, which have not been previously explored in this context. Impact on Society This study provides knowledge to high schools for improving the use of LMS in educational environments post-COVID-19, leading to an enhanced teaching-learning process. Future Research This study, however, is limited to collecting responses exclusively from Indonesian respondents. Therefore, the replication of the finding needs to consider the characteristics and culture similar to Indonesian students, which is regarded as the limitation of this study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","GETAMEL; high school; Learning Management System (LMS); SEM; SOR","Economic and social effects; Actual use; E - learning; Extended technology acceptance models; General extended technology acceptance model for E-learning; Higher School; Indirect effects; Learning management system; Stimulus-organism-response; Structural equation models; Students"

While there is much ongoing informatics work embedding social needs screening and referrals into health care systems and their electronic health records, there has been less focus on the digital ecosystem and needs of community-based organizations (CBOs) providing or connecting individuals to these resources. Objective: We used human-centered design to develop a digital platform for CBOs, focused on identification of health and social resources and communication with their clients. Methods: Centered in the Develop phase of the design process, we conducted in-depth interviews in 2 phases with community-based organizational leadership and staff to create and iterate on the platform. We elicited and mapped participant feedback to theory-informed domains from the Technology Acceptance Model, such as Usefulness and Ease of Use, to build the final product and summarized all major design decisions as the platform development proceeded. Results: Overall, we completed 22 interviews with 18 community-based organizational leadership and staff in 2 consecutive Develop phases. After coding of the interview transcripts, there were 4 major themes related to usability, relevance, and external factors impacting use. Specifically, CBOs expressed an interest in a customer relationship management software to manage their client interactions and communications, and they needed specific additional features to address the scope of their everyday work, namely (1) digital and SMS text messaging communication with clients and (2) easy ways to identify relevant community resources based on diverse client needs and various program eligibility criteria. Finally, clear implementation needs emerged, such as digital training and support for staff using new platforms. The final platform, titled “Mapping to Enhance the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods (MAVEN),” was completed in the Salesforce environment in 2022, and it included features and functions directly mapped to the design process. Conclusions: Engaging community organizations in user-centered design of a health and social resource platform was essential to tapping into their deep expertise in serving local communities and neighborhoods. Design methods informed by behavioral theory can be similarly employed in other informatics research. Moving forward, much more work will be necessary to support the implementation of platforms specific to CBOs’ needs, especially given the resources, training, and customization needed in these settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","application; co-design; community; community health; community-based; digital ecosystem; digital health; eHealth; electronic health; health resources; human-centered design; informatics; innovation; mHealth; mobile health; operations; population health; qualitative analysis; social needs; technology",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a quantitative design; data were collected by surveying B-school students in Hyderabad using a questionnaire prepared adopting the validated scales. About 33 items were used to measure nine reflective constructs: remote learning, performance expectancy, adoption behavioral intention, institutional support, ecological acceptance, habit formation, hedonic motivation, attitude towards conference apps and social influence. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out, and hypotheses were tested using IBM SPSS and AMOS version 28. Findings: A 61% variance in students’ adoption behavioral intentions and a 37% variance in students’ attitude towards conference apps are accounted for by remote learning, performance expectancy, institutional support, ecological acceptance, habit formation, hedonic motivation and social influence. The exogenous constructs of institutional support, environmental acceptance, habit formation and social influence are statistically significant and influence students’ adoption and behavioral intentions toward conference applications. The attitude towards conference apps fully mediated the relationship between students’ adoption behavioral intentions and performance expectancy. However, the constructs of environmental concern, social influence and habit formation are partially mediated. This study provides empirical evidence that attitude towards conference apps, environmental acceptance, performance expectancy, institutional support, habit formation and social influence are the key predictors of remote learning and students’ adoption of and conference applications. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to the B-schools of Hyderabad city, an Indian metro. To encourage students to adopt remote learning through conference apps, academicians should appropriately illustrate the idea of remote learning. To enable students to learn while on the go, educational institutions should offer intuitive applications with enhanced reading layouts. Second, since internet access is required for remote learning, this study is crucial for service providers. To make it simpler to obtain educational resources, the internet should be more widely accessible. Third, since technology is linked to remote learning, this type of study is essential for the education sector since devices need to be developed. Practical implications: The pandemic has caused restructuring of the educational system, necessitating new strategies for distance and virtual learning for teachers. In the future, teachers will adopt techniques centered around the use of virtual platforms, social media and video production. The government should establish sufficient infrastructure to facilitate online education and assist instructors in becoming more knowledgeable and proficient in the use of technology, especially when creating, executing and assessing online instruction. Originality/value: The purpose of this study is to determine how beneficial it is to use online/remote learning with Zoom, BlueJeans, Microsoft Teams and other conference software in particular. Both the online/remote learning method itself and the learners' capacities and capabilities for adjusting to new normal scenarios should be developed in educational environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption behavioral intention; Conference applications; Ease of use; Environmental concern; Technology adoption model",""

This study aims to address this shift by developing a conceptual framework grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Diffusion of Innovation theory. The framework identifies and analyses the factors influencing Vietnamese consumers’ decisions to install PV panels, focusing on the roles of consumer innovativeness, government incentives and social influence. By examining these dynamics, this study offers insights to inform policy in promoting renewable energy adoption. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 339 Vietnamese households were analysed using SmartPLS 3.0 to test the proposed hypotheses. A structured questionnaire survey focused on consumer innovativeness, government incentives and social influence. The partial least squares structural equation modelling approach was used to evaluate the relationships between constructs. Findings: The findings indicate that consumer innovativeness significantly predicts knowledge, sustainable lifestyles and attitudes towards solar PV panels. Moreover, household attitudes are influenced by government incentives and knowledge, but not by sustainable lifestyles. Crucially, the intention to install solar PV panels among Vietnamese households is positively affected by facilitating conditions, government incentives and social influence. Originality/value: The results can assist government officials and policymakers in emerging markets in devising strategies to alleviate environmental burdens and facilitate a shift towards sustainability. Furthermore, by understanding the factors impacting the residents’ intention, public communication can be improved to raise awareness of environmental concerns and sustainable lifestyles, which results in the encouragement of the purchase and installation intention of solar panels. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer innovativeness; Government incentives; Knowledge; Solar panels; Vietnam",""

It benefited the concerned stakeholders, including management, teachers, and the students, to retain in the system, but it reinforced pre-existing discrimination among students from various disadvantaged groups. Studies reveal that the online learning system created an environment that facilitated students’ motive and interest in learning who disengaged themselves from classrooms due to various socioeconomic reasons during the pandemic. The present study explored students’ experience and perception of online learning in Nepal and analyzed the predictors of their interest in participating in the new learning environments. More specifically, it studied how the online modes of learning were associated with the interests of disadvantaged higher education students in their academic pursuits during the COVID-19 pandemic and how online learning impacted the pre-existing discrimination among them. The study generated concepts and variables drawing from the technology acceptance model (TAM) and a review of existing literature. A survey among 324 higher education students and a follow-up interview among nine selected respondents were conducted in Nepal between April and June 2021. The sample represented students from all social classes, genders, financial status, and geographies. Using a logistic regression model of the survey data and thematic analysis of interviews, this study found that compared to others, students from disadvantaged groups were significantly motivated by the online learning system. Their perception of online learning was positive despite the shortcomings of the system, such as the lack of internet infrastructure and the continuous flow of electricity. Students’ motivation toward the online learning system was triggered by their perception, which helped them to retain and continue in the higher education system. Based on the findings, this study concludes that in a developing country like Nepal, where students face social, economic, and geographical challenges in accessing higher education, the online learning system could be an effective alternative to traditional face-to-face learning to minimize pre-existing discrimination. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19; disadvantaged students; higher education (HE); Nepal; online learning; technology acceptance",""

Nevertheless, the acceptance of computer-based intelligence in advanced educational settings is still faced with various difficulties, including perceived dangers, implementation assumptions, and exertion assumptions. This exploration plans to determine the relationship between risk policies, implementation assumptions, and effort assumptions with social expectations regarding the acceptance of computer-based intelligence innovations in advanced educational organizations in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Moreover, this exploration also tests the role of social goals as a mediator variable connecting these elements. As a research method, a survey was conducted using a survey of students and academic staff from various universities in North Sulawesi with a sample size of 330 people with different educational backgrounds. The research results show that risk perception, performance expectations, and effort expectations have a large influence on behavioral intentions to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. In addition, this study found that behavioral intention acts as a moderator that moderates the relationship between perceived risks, performance expectations; while effort expectations through behavioral intentions do not have a significant influence on AI adoption. These results provide valuable insights for higher education institutions in planning AI adoption strategies, with a focus on managing perceived risk, increasing performance expectations, and reducing effort expectations. In addition, this research also highlights the large role of recognizing behavioral intentions in the process of adopting AI technology in higher education, so that it can increase the effectiveness of its implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial intelligence; behavioral intention; Higher Education; higher education; Sustainability Education, Training & Leadership",""

This paper addresses this gap by exploring the metaverse’s potential to advance sustainable practices in tourism, aligning with sustainable development goals (SDGs).By integrating three behavioural theories–the Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Acceptance Model, and Self-Determination Theory–this research provides a comprehensive framework to assess the impact of metaverse tourism on sustainability and identify the most relevant SDGs. Through a systematic meta-analysis, the study presents four key propositions: foundational technologies will redefine travel experiences through immersive engagements; metaverse tourists may develop more realistic expectations, altering travel dynamics; understanding the diverse identities of metaverse tourists is crucial; and metaverse tourism introduces an innovative business model aligned with the creative economy. This interdisciplinary approach offers insights into the transformative potential of metaverse tourism, bridging technology, tourism, and behavioural psychology. The research underscores the importance of exploring these intersections, contributing valuable insights to the evolving tourism landscape amidst changing consumer expectations and sustainability imperatives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavioral theories; creative economy; immersive experiences; Metaverse tourism; sustainable growth",""

Design/methodology/approach: The model was developed by extending TAM, through the inclusion of three additional variables: trust (T), image (I), and information quality (IQ). Thus, the proposed model involves seven variables: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Attitude to Use (AU), Intention to Use (IU), trust (T), image (I), and Information Quality (IQ). For model testing purposes, data were collected from 100 users through a survey conducted in three Indonesian provinces: Central Java, West Kalimantan, and Riau. The analysis consists of measurement model analysis, structural model analysis, and model fit test. The analysis was conducted using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The model was proven to be fit, valid, and reliable, with all hypotheses being confirmed. In the context of a satellite-based hydrometeorology early warning system, perceived usefulness (PU) positively and significantly influences the attitude to use (AU). Furthermore, perceived usefulness (PU) also has a positive and significant impact on the intention to use (IU). Additionally, perceived usefulness (PU) is shown to be affected by external factors, namely trust (T) and image (I). Perceived ease of use (PEU) is found to have a positive and significant impact on attitude to use (AU). Furthermore, perceived ease of use (PEU) is influenced by external factors specifically image (I) and information quality (IQ). The attitude to use (AU) is found to have a positive and significant effect on the intention to use (IU). Originality/value: An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to test the acceptance of disaster early warning system technology is rare, even though the technology is vital. Research limitations/implications: In terms of generalization, this study is limited to the acceptance of the satellite-based hydrometeorology early warning system in Indonesia. Future research should apply the model to other contexts to test its applicability and stability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Early warning system; Earth Sciences; Environmental Management; Hui Shan Loh, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore; hydrometeorology; Indonesia; partial least squares structural equation modeling; satellite; Statistics & Probability; technology acceptance model",""

This study was conducted using the advanced Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)-3 model to assess the potential of OBE systems in enhancing teaching and learning processes. The study integrated a comprehensive set of nine variables to measure the acceptance level of OBE systems among lecturers at Maranatha Christian University Bandung and Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang. UTAUT-3 provides a more explicit understanding by incorporating Hedonic Motivation (H.M.), Habit (H), and Personal Innovativeness (P.I.). The Model also integrated the core constructs of Performance Expectancy (P.E.), Effort Expectancy (E.E.), Social Influence (S.I.), Facilitating Conditions (F.C.), Behavioral Intention (B.I.), and Users Behavior (U.B.). The result showed that B.I. was a central determinant of U.B., suggesting users' preparedness to engage with OBE systems. Furthermore, the routine use of technology as Habit (H) was closely related to Behavioral Intension (B.I.), showing that familiarity with technology facilitated the intention to adopt OBE systems. The result showed that UTAUT-3's comprehensive framework was superior in evaluating educational technology adoption due to its ability to account for users' engagement as Hedonic Motivation (H.M.), dispositional tendencies toward Personal Innovativeness (P.I.), and the critical role of established habits. Consumers' actual experiences and technological proficiency significantly influence adoption rather than individual characteristics. Therefore, UTAUT-3 was a more effective tool for predicting and understanding the Acceptance of OBE systems, guiding educational institutions toward successfully integrating information systems in learning environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance; education; outcome-based; use of technology",""

Its application extends to higher education, proving invaluable for pre-service teacher training through an authentic simulation of classroom dynamics. Acknowledging the pivotal role of student acceptance and comfort with this technology, this research aims to understand the factors influencing its efficacy. To measure acceptance, students actively engaged in a competency activity, immersing themselves in the analysis of a 360-degree-recorded classroom practice within a Primary Education setting. Subsequently, a structured questionnaire, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), was administered. This questionnaire assessed the factors influencing the acceptance of this educational technology across eight dimensions and their behavioral intentions to use it. Results from this investigation underscore that the factors Hedonic Motivation, Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy received the highest ratings among participants. Conversely, lower ratings were observed for Habit and Price Value. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the UTAUT2 model effectively captured preservice teachers’ perceptions of iVR across all dimensions (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, Habit and Behavioural Intention). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","e-Learning; Immersive Virtual Reality; Pre-Service Teacher Training; UTAUT2 Model",""

Despite this potential, a thorough understanding of how 3-D concrete printing (3DCP) technology is adopted within the construction sector is still lacking, especially regarding the role of individuals within organizations in facilitating this adoption. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a conceptual model that integrates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. We validate this model using survey data from 190 employees across various organizations in mainland China. Our results highlight the critical role of individual assessments - encompassed by performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and price value - in promoting the organizational adoption of 3DCP. Additionally, we found that technological and environmental factors moderate this relationship, whereas organizational factors exhibit only a negligible influence. This research not only sheds light on the dynamics of 3DCP's organizational adoption in the construction sector, but also extends the theoretical integration of UTAUT and TOE.

The study utilized a model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as an extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). Design/methodology/approach: An online platform tool (Prolific), and online self-report questionnaires were used to gather empirical data on 309 individuals. These data were then analyzed using two-step structural equation modeling. Findings: The model explained 76% of the variance in user adoption of food-sharing mobile applications and internet platforms, supporting seven out of the nine tested hypotheses. Effort expectancy, social influence and IAFW were found to be the significant determinants of the behavioural intention to use food-sharing mobile applications and internet platforms (BITA). IAFW partially mediated the relationship between perceived behavior control and BITA. Age played a moderator role between the adoption of food-sharing mobile applications and internet platforms. However, IAFW did not play a mediating role between environmental concerns and BITA. The facilitating condition construct had an insignificant impact on BITA. Research limitations/implications: The current study was affected by some limitations. First, the data may not be considered as statistically representative because they were gathered online. However, the varied sociodemographic backgrounds of the respondents would boost the reliability of the findings. However, it would be prudent to use caution when extrapolating these findings to other contexts and cultures. Second, environmental concerns and perceived behavior control related to the avoidance of food waste behavior, as well as other factors that affect technology acceptance, may alter with time. Data from cross-sections may cause difficulties in following such changes. Thus, we recommend that longitudinal research studies aimed at building on our findings should be conducted. A qualitative study may help gain deeper insights into the relationship between IAFW related behavior and the adoption of various technologies to share leftover food, thereby revealing further details regarding different perspectives held by various respondents. Practical implications: The positive relationship between environmental concerns and IAFW underlines the significance of investing in this area to raise social awareness and public concern for environmental safety. Additional initiatives aimed at increasing public concern regarding environmental issues may increase the overall IAFW. Instead of concentrating on a single source pertaining to the avoidance of food waste, the government and policy regulations should focus on regulating and eliminating waste from all sources that generate waste. The adoption of technology to share leftover meals may be influenced by social factors. Increased advertising for food-sharing mobile apps and online platforms may persuade more users to join. Additionally, building additional platforms and mobile apps in these fields with friendlier interactions may improve the cyber environment, making it easier for people to use them. By providing information, tools and assistance to promote the reduction of food wastage, policymakers may create interventions that enhance public perception and behavior toward the reduction of food waste. In conclusion, the findings of our study indicated that the social impact and ease of use are important factors in determining the adoption of food-sharing technology. Cooperation with social influencers, policymakers and developers may lead to the development of user-friendly technology that may improve accessibility to food-sharing technology. Social implications: In order to encourage the adoption of food-sharing technology among various age groups, policymakers may create initiatives that take the specific requirements and traits of each group into consideration. Policymakers and governments may also create legislation and regulations that are tailored to guarantee food safety and health security for users of food-sharing technology, such as instructions for handling and storing food as well as safeguards against food fraud and contamination. Originality/value: This study addressed practical issues related to managing and reducing household food wastage through social sharing via mobile applications and internet platforms.

It employs the integration of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Information System Success Model (ISSM). Background Electronic government, transforming citizen-state interactions, has gained momentum worldwide, including in India, where the aim is to leverage technology to improve citizen services, streamline administration, and engage the public. While prior research has explored factors influencing citizen satisfaction with e-government services globally, this area of study has been relatively unexplored in India, particularly in the post-COVID era. Challenges to widespread e-government adoption in India include a large and diverse population, limited digital infrastructure in rural areas, low digital literacy, and weak data protection regulations. Additionally, global declines in citizen trust,attributed to economic concerns, corruption, and information disclosures, further complicate the scenario. This study seeks to investigate the influence of various factors on user satisfaction and continuance usage of e-government services in India. It also aims to understand how these services contribute to building citizens’ trust in government. Methodology The data were collected by utilizing survey items on drivers of e-government services, user satisfaction, citizen trust, and continuance use intention derived from existing literature on information systems and e-government. Responses from 501 Indian participants, collected using an online questionnaire, were analyzed using PLS-SEM. Contribution This study makes a dual contribution to the e-government domain.

The proposed model integrates the TAM and ISSM. Combining these models allows for a comprehensive examination of e-government satisfaction and continued intention. By analyzing the impact of user satisfaction on continuance intention and citizen trust through an integrated model, researchers and practitioners gain insights into the complex dynamics involved. Second, the study uncovers the effects of residential status on user satisfaction, trust, and continuance intention regarding e-government services. Findings reveal disparities in the influence of system and service quality on user satisfaction across different user segments. Researchers and policymakers should consider these insights when designing e-government services to ensure user satisfaction, continuance intention, and the building of citizen trust. Findings The findings indicate that the quality of information, service, system, and perceived usefulness play important roles in user satisfaction with e-government services. All hypothesized paths were significant, except for perceived ease of use. Furthermore, the study highlights that user satisfaction significantly impacts citizen trust and continuance use intention. Recommendations The findings suggest that government authorities should focus on delivering for Practitioners accurate, comprehensive, and timely information in a secure, glitch-free, and user-friendly digital environment. Implementing an interactive and accessible interface, ensuring compatibility across devices, and implementing swift query resolution mechanisms collectively contribute to improving users’ satisfaction. Conducting awareness and training initiatives, providing 24×7 access to online tutorials, helpdesks, technical support, clear FAQs, and integrating AI-driven customer service support can further ensure a seamless user experience. Government institutions should leverage social influence, community engagement, and social media campaigns to enhance user trust. Promotional campaigns, incentive programs, endorsements, and user testimonials should be used to improve users’ satisfaction and continuance intention. Recommendations An integrated model combining TAM and ISSM offers a robust approach for for Researchers thoroughly analyzing the diverse factors influencing user satisfaction and continuance intention in the evolving digitalization landscape of e-government services. This expansion, aligning with ISSM’s perspective, enhances the literature by demonstrating how user satisfaction impacts continuance usage intention and citizen trust in e-government services in India and other emerging economies.Impact on Society Examining the factors influencing user satisfaction and continuance intention in e-government services and their subsequent impact on citizen trust carries significant societal implications. The findings can contribute to the establishment of transparent and accountable governance practices, fostering a stronger connection between governments and their citizens. Future Research There are several promising avenues to explore to enhance future research. Expanding the scope by incorporating a larger sample size could enable a more thorough analysis. Alternatively, delving into the performance of specific e-government services would offer greater precision, considering that this study treats e-government services generically. Additionally, incorporating in-depth interviews and longitudinal studies would yield a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic evolution of digitalization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","citizen trust; continuance intention; e-government; India; user satisfaction","e-government; Information systems; Population statistics; Public administration; Citizen trust; Continuance intentions; Continuance usages; e-Government; E-government services; India; Information systems success models; Technology acceptance model; Use intentions; Users' satisfactions; Information use"

Traditional recruitment processes, with manual stages, are time-consuming and inefficient. Artificial Intelligence (AI), which demonstrates its potential in various sectors such as healthcare, education, and notable cases of ChatGPT, is currently reshaping recruitment by automating tasks to improve efficiency. However, in Thailand, where there is a growing demand for talents, the application of AI in recruitment remains relatively limited. This study focuses on human resources (HR) and recruitment professionals in Thailand, aiming to understand their perspectives on the integration of AI in recruitment. It utilized the Unified Theory for Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, customized to suit the specific requirements of Thailand recruitment practices. The study explores the factors influencing users’ intention to adopt AI in recruitment. Survey questionnaire items were created based on prior literature and refined with insights from HR and recruitment experts to ensure applicability in the context of recruitment in Thailand. A survey involving 364 HR and recruiting professionals in the Bangkok metropolitan area supplied comprehensive responses. The study reveals that several factors, including perceived value, perceived autonomy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions, significantly impact the intention to adopt AI for recruitment. While social influence and trust in AI technology do not have a direct influence on intention, social influence directly affects perceived value. Trust in AI technology positively influences Effort Expectancy.

The MVTECH promised to provide a number of potentials for various sectors including higher education. Despite the fact that MVTECH promotes virtual social interaction between people (e.g., university students), there is a lack of knowledge on what affects users’ perceptions regarding its social sustainability in HEIs, specifically in developing nations. Therefore, this research paper aims to determine the variables that affect the learners’ perceptions toward social sustainability (SS) of MVTECH in higher educational institutions (HEIs) in Jordan. A study model was formulated by integrating the core factors of the “unified theory of acceptance and use of technology” (UTAUT) (“performance expectancy, PE; effort expectancy, EE; social influence, SI; and facilitating conditions, FC”) with “perceived curiosity” (PC) and “extraversion” (EXT) factors. Both PC and EXT were included as context-related variables that may possibly contribute to enhancing the applicability of UTAUT to a wide range of information technologies and settings. Data were collected from 422 students enrolled in Jordanian universities based on an online survey. The analysis of the “structural equation modeling” (SEM) found that students’ perceptions toward Metaverse were significantly influenced by PE, FC, and EXT. Furthermore, the PC construct significantly affected the EE construct. However, EE and SI were revealed to have no significant impact on SS. Drawing from these results, the study makes a number of theoretical advances and clarifies a number of practical implications for those involved in the development, design, and decision-making processes that support the use of the Metaverse in HEIs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","curiosity; developing nations; extraversion; HEIs; Metaverse; social sustainability; UTAUT","educational development; higher education; perception; social media; spatial cognition; student; sustainability; technology adoption; virtual reality; Jordan"

Farmers are also among those who cannot survive without the proper acquisition and application of Information. However, very few studies have considered the farmer’s need for and the seeking of information which is why to fill this gap, the study looked into the information sources used by farm growers to get the required information, the influence of land size on the utilization of information sources, and how different characteristics related to sources and individuals influence attitude toward the usage of internet sources and provided a model that takes into consideration crucial factors and their influence on attitude toward searching for information from Internet sources. Data were acquired from 400 farmers using a multistage stratified disproportionate sampling procedure and a standardized questionnaire. For evaluating the given data, various analysis techniques were utilized such as Descriptive statistics, Correlation analysis, One-way ANOVA, Factor analysis, and Multiple regression Analysis. The data were evaluated by using SPSS version 25. Farmers, according to the findings, mostly rely on other farmers and input dealers, and mass media sources of information like radio, television, magazines, and newspapers, to acquire information associated with agricultural activities. They commonly utilize mobile social media apps when surfing the internet. Furthermore, the findings discovered that there is a significant difference in the usage of various sources of information, including television, radio, newspapers/magazines, other farmers, input dealers, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Krishi melas, the state department of agriculture, state agriculture universities, and the Internet on mobile phones-social media applications, depending on the farmers’ farm size. The findings also revealed that the factors that were significantly positively associated with farmers’ attitudes about internet use were, perceived usefulness, ease of use, information quality, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The technology Acceptance Model was used as the foundation for the research framework. By examining past research, the study has discovered additional factors that may influence technology adoption in addition to the two main components of the Technology Acceptance Model, namely perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The proposed model may assist information providers in their attempts to lessen and overcome barriers to farmers’ usage of technology. When building effective extension and dissemination programs, the preferred information-gathering modalities of a certain group of farmers should be considered. Intervention techniques must take into account the wide range of information that needs to be seen in farming communities. As a result, information providers must provide context-specific information through the sources that farmers prefer, while also considering the factors that influence their adoption and overcoming those barriers that prohibit farmers from using such sources. The study categorized farmers into four categories based on land size, which would assist information providers in acquiring a thorough grasp of each category of farmer and in developing separate and unique strategies for each type of farmer. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","information search behavior; information sources; internet use; technology adoption; the channel of information",""

Community-based electric ride-sharing as a pilot project has been introduced to reduce residents’ reliance on private cars in Bangkok, Thailand. This study integrated the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and goal-framing theory to explain the cognitive process from intending a trial ride to sustaining behavioral change to substitute present travel modes. A sample of 101 valid responses was collected from the service users. The findings show a pivotal role of travel-related self-efficacy in encouraging users to keep using the promoted service by finding eudaimonic and normative goals during the intervention. Multi-group analysis was further applied to examine the moderating roles of transport mode preferences on hypothesized relationships. Pilot service users showed overall high self-efficacy associated with community-based mobility, and the stated self-efficacy was positively related to the intention to sustain behavior change.

Despite these benefits, their adoption rate remains limited due to various factors influencing users’ decisions. While previous studies have identified numerous factors influencing AV adoption using various adoption frameworks, the factors have not been comprehensively analyzed and synthesized. Thus, this systematic review aims to bridge this gap by identifying and classifying the factors influencing the adoption of AVs. Out of 3,532 collected research papers, 71 empirical studies were analyzed thoroughly. The findings demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) was the most widely used model for investigating AV adoption. The identified factors in the analyzed studies were classified into distinct categories: psychological and behavioral factors, technological factors, social factors, environmental factors, security and privacy factors, AV-related factors, risky and negative factors, conditional factors, and monetary factors. We have proposed an AV adoption framework grounded in this taxonomy to direct subsequent empirical research.

As a result, the existing, overworked staff are struggling to meet the ever-increasing demands and provide the desired quality of care. One of the promising technological solutions that could complement the human workforce and alleviate some of their workload, are socially assistive humanoid robots. However, despite their potential, the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots is often challenging due to low acceptance among key stakeholders, namely, patients and healthcare professionals. Hence, the present study first investigated the extent to which these stakeholders accept the use of socially assistive humanoid robots in nursing and care routine, and second, explored the characteristics that contribute to higher/lower acceptance within these groups, with a particular emphasis on demographic variables, technology expectations, ethical acceptability, and negative attitudes. In study 1, conducted on a sample of 490 healthcare professionals, the results of structural equation modeling showed that acceptance is driven primarily by aspects of ethical acceptability, although education and technology expectations also exert an indirect effect. In study 2, conducted on a sample of 371 patients, expectations regarding capabilities and attitudes towards the social influence of robots emerged as important predictors of acceptance. Moreover, although acceptance rates differed between tasks, both studies show a relatively high acceptance of socially assistive humanoid robots. Despite certain limitations, the study findings provide essential knowledge that enhances our understanding of stakeholders’ perceptions and acceptance of socially assistive humanoid robots in hospital environments, and may guide their deployment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes; Expectations; Healthcare professionals; Patients; Socially assistive humanoid robots; Structural equation modeling","Anthropomorphic robots; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Hospitals; Assistive; Attitude; Expectation; Health care professionals; Healthcare systems; Humanoid robot; Patient; Socially assistive humanoid robot; Structural equation models; Technology expectations; Nursing"

Mobile learning software refers to the use of mobile applications through smart devices for promoting online learning. However, the effectiveness of such software in learning for sustainability depends on users’ intention to adopt it. While there is growing interest in using mobile technology for sustainability education, empirical evidence on how personalized mobile software can influence users’ attitudes and behaviors toward sustainable practices is limited. Thus, this study investigates the factors that affect users’ acceptance of mobile learning technology in sustainability education, by integrating environmental awareness and personalization strategies into a modified model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). A total of 120 users participated in the survey. An empirical analysis of data was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the relationship between the variables of the model. The results showed that both environmental awareness and personalization strategies had a significant effect on users’ behavioral intentions. In addition, hedonic motivation and habit exerted an effect on behavioral intention, contrary to effort expectancy and social influence. These findings confirm that a personalized mobile learning application related to environmental issues reveals as a powerful tool for supporting environmental education since such software appears to have high acceptance by the user. The significance of the study lies in its potential to inform the design and development of personalized mobile applications for sustainability education. The study contributes to the creation of more effective mobile applications that promote sustainable behavior and contribute to a more sustainable future by identifying the elements that influence user acceptance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance model; environmental awareness; mobile software; sustainable learning; TAM; UTAUT","Application programs; E-learning; Environmental technology; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Mobile computing; Acceptance models; Environmental awareness; Mobile applications; Mobile Learning; Mobile softwares; Sustainability education; Sustainable learning; TAM; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Users' acceptance; Sustainable development"

The risks and harmful effects of digital media on children have forced parents to engage in several types of digital media mediation strategies. Applying the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behaviour in understanding the parental mediation strategy, this study explores parents’ perception of their own responsibilities and the development of appropriate policies and legislation to curve the risk of digital media in their children's lives. An online survey of 331 parents was conducted. The data was analyzed using structured equation modeling. Findings reveal that the fundamental variables of protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behaviour are mostly held to explain the psychological and external-environmental factors that impact parents’ digital media mediation strategy. This study also deduces that parents who apply restrictive and active mediation strategies prefer both governmental regulation and parent responsibility. In contrast, the parents who apply distant mediation prefer just government regulation.

These worlds intertwine so closely that it is often impossible to distinguish one from the other. Unrestricted access to new technologies has transformed the nature of childhood. Increasingly, younger children are now shaping their perception of the world through constant exposure to media. When analysing a child’s development, interaction with parents is the most crucial factor. Shared time is essential for building relationships and fostering the child’s understanding of the world around them. This article addresses the important issue of loneliness in young children. Mental well-being, a pillar of self-acceptance, is a key element of personal development. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the sense of security globally. The aim of these theoretical considerations is to highlight the issue of loneliness experienced by children when interacting with new technologies, which often plays a crucial role in the development of addictions. In a world dominated by media, which are both ever-popular and easily accessible, there is a significant risk that inappropriate behaviours may emerge in the youngest. These behaviours can hinder the development of a healthy self-image. The balance of children’s coexistence in the modern world depends not only on the children themselves but also on their parents and teachers.

However, graduate medical education (GME) trainee perspectives on VR acceptability and usability are limited. The behavioral intentions of GME trainees with regard to VR as an anxiolytic tool have not been characterized through a theoretical framework of technology adoption. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to apply a hybrid Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to evaluate factors that predict the behavioral intentions of GME trainees to use VR for patient anxiolysis. The secondary aim was to assess the reliability of the TAM-UTAUT. Methods: Participants were surveyed in June 2023. GME trainees participated in a VR experience used to reduce perioperative anxiety. Participants then completed a survey evaluating demographics, perceptions, attitudes, environmental factors, and behavioral intentions that influence the adoption of new technologies. Results: In total, 202 of 1540 GME trainees participated. Only 198 participants were included in the final analysis (12.9% participation rate). Perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment; social influence; and facilitating conditions predicted intention to use VR. Age, past use, price willing to pay, and curiosity were less strong predictors of intention to use. All confirmatory factor analysis models demonstrated a good fit. All domain measurements demonstrated acceptable reliability. Conclusions: This TAM-UTAUT demonstrated validity and reliability for predicting the behavioral intentions of GME trainees to use VR as a therapeutic anxiolytic in clinical practice. Social influence and facilitating conditions are modifiable factors that present opportunities to advance VR adoption, such as fostering exposure to new technologies and offering relevant training and social encouragement. Future investigations should study the model’s reliability within specialties in different geographic locations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","factor analysis; graduate medical education trainees; medical education; TAM; Technology Acceptance Model; technology adoption; technology assessment; United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; UTAUT; virtual reality; VR",""

Results show that expertise competency and communication ability are highly related to students’ digital literacy; Motivation awareness, technology acceptance, cognitive learning strategies, learning outcome, innovation and critical ability moderately related to students’ digital literacy; Digital exposure weakly related to students’ digital literacy. Besides, the relationship between digital exposure, technology acceptance with students’ digital literacy is significantly moderated by the grade variable. These findings offer valuable insights into educational practices, skill enhancement, and social development. First, we should stimulate students’ interest and willingness to explore emerging digital technologies through various teaching strategies. Second, strategically integrate digital technology with the development of core twenty-first-century competencies, including communication skills, innovative and critical thinking, expertise competence, etc. Finally, advocate for the multi-party collaboration in improving students digital literacy, together create a good digital development environment for students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital literacy; influencing factors; meta analysis; students digital literacy; technology acceptance","Teaching; Analysis method; Cognitive learning strategies; Digital literacies; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Influencing factor; Meta-analysis; Student digital literacy; Technology acceptance; Students"

In training within the learning process, i.e., exploring learned material rather than introducing it, educators may think congruence tutoring will fit as a tool for applying this principle. By developing a cognitive congruence-performing model, the study aims to objectivise cognitive congruence, i.e., involve aligning learning goals with learning experience processing, student abilities or learning styles with instructional design, and tutoring with tuteeing and delivering to the educational cluster. Here, the question arises of why and how the cognitive congruence principle can reconfigure the learning experience.

Social acceptance is a decisive factor in the successful implementation of geothermal projects. Main text: This systematic review summarizes the major aspects and evaluates the crucial outcomes of recent research on community acceptance as a dimension of social acceptance of geothermal technology since 2011, on a global scale. From the literature, we identified and grouped researched acceptance factors into five main acceptance categories, namely ‘project organization and process’, ‘environment’, ‘municipality’, ‘technology’, and ‘governance’. Each category comprises a number of specific acceptance factors addressed by different survey methods (e.g., interviews, questionnaires, content analyses) in the relevant publications. The acceptance factor categories ‘technology’ and ‘governance’ are remarkably underrepresented, whereas the acceptance factors combined in the categories ‘project organization’ and ‘municipality’ are frequently mentioned in the literature. Acceptance factors combined within the category ‘environment’, ‘trust in key actors’, and ‘information about the project’ are expectedly the most dominant ones in the papers studied. Interestingly, acceptance categories and number of mentions of acceptance factors are comparable in all survey methods applied in the various studies. Besides the acceptance factors combined in the categories ‘environment’ and ‘project organization and process’, ‘knowledge about geothermal technology’ (an acceptance factor from the category ‘municipality’) represents the predominant acceptance factor of geothermal technology. Conclusions: Deeper knowledge, in particular about the technical aspects of geothermal energy generation, might enable a more comprehensive and holistic view on geothermal technology. Furthermore, the integration of all relevant groups of stakeholders in the process of implementation of geothermal projects strongly influences their social acceptance. Following the results of our systematic literature review, we propose these aspects should be addressed in more detail in future research on the community acceptance of geothermal technology and energy production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Community acceptance; Energy transition; Environmental impact; Geothermal energy; Induced seismicity; Renewable energy","Earthquakes; Economic and social effects; Geothermal fields; Induced Seismicity; Social aspects; Community acceptance; Energy productions; Energy transitions; Geothermal projects; Project organization; Project process; Renewable energies; Social acceptance; Survey methods; Systematic Review; Environmental impact; alternative energy; environmental impact; geothermal energy; induced seismicity; literature review; stakeholder; survey method"

The research will explore urban dwellers' traditional understanding and knowledge of the food growing process acquired over the course of their lives. We conducted in-depth interviews with residents of a selected block of flats in Łódź, who expressed their willingness to participate in an Urban Living Lab. As part of it, they would grow food for a year using hydroponic installation located in the corridors of their block. As a result of our analyses, we have identified the dominant traditions and social culture associated with growing food among the future participants of the Urban Living Lab, focusing primarily on the educational aspects. This is because we assume that effective educational interventions are an essential tool in the process of shaping the pro-environmental behaviour of city dwellers.

Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) have emerged as a strategy to mitigate these adverse effects. This study examines community preferences regarding CBAs associated with large-scale solar farms. Our investigation focuses on two critical CBAs aspects: the choice between mandated or voluntary implementation and the preference for private or collective benefit distribution. Additionally, we explore how individual values shape community members' attitudes towards solar technology. Our findings reveal a clear preference within the surveyed community for privately distributing benefits over establishing a collective trust fund, and for voluntary implementation rather than government mandates. However, it is essential to recognize that the community is not monolithic and can be placed into three classes: a minority of solar-reluctant individuals (7.5 %), a significant solar-receptive group (24.2 %), and a substantial disengaged majority (68.3 %). Among these groups, the solar-receptive segment displays the most interest in private benefits; yet, they favor government-mandated agreements. Moreover, values play a significant role in shaping preferences within each group, with biospherism correlating with greater support for mandated, private benefits among respondents in the reluctant and receptive groups. Conversely, hedonistic values predict a greater inclination among the reluctant group to live further away from solar developments. Based on these findings, policies should prioritize voluntary, private benefit distribution while remaining adaptable to align with community preferences. Engaging community members in the decision-making can help tailor solutions that resonate with their values and preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agreements; Community acceptance; Community benefits; Discrete choice experiments; Distributive justice; Energy transition; Individual values; Non-market valuation; Renewable energy; Solar farm",""

As a power-to-x technology, green hydrogen is set to become a key component of a future sustainable energy system. With a view to averting conflicts like those surrounding wind energy, we have investigated social acceptance of green hydrogen at an early stage in its implementation, before wider rollout. Our study uses a mixed-method approach, wherein semi-structured interviews (n = 24) and two participatory workshops (n = 51) in a selected region in central Germany serve alongside a representative survey (n = 2054) as the basis for both understanding social attitudes and reaching generalisable conclusions. Results: Overall, it is possible to observe both a marked lack of knowledge and a large degree of openness towards green hydrogen and its local use, along with high expectations regarding environmental and climate protection. We reach three key conclusions. First, acceptance of green hydrogen relies on trust in science, government, the media, and institutions that uphold distributive justice, with consideration for regional values playing a vital role in establishing said trust. Second, methodologically sound participatory processes can promote acceptance, and active support in particular. Third, recurrent positive participatory experiences can effectively foster trust. Conclusions: Accordingly, we argue that trust should be strengthened on a structural level, and that green hydrogen acceptance should be understood as a matter of responsible innovation. As the first empirical investigation into social acceptance of green hydrogen, and by conceptually interlinking acceptance research and responsible innovation, this study constitutes an important contribution to existing research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Green hydrogen; Participation; Responsible innovation; Social acceptance; Trust","Social aspects; Green energy; Green hydrogen; Mixed method; Participation; Power; Responsible innovation; Semi structured interviews; Social acceptance; Sustainable energy systems; Trust; Wind power; alternative energy; green economy; innovation; participatory approach; spatiotemporal analysis; wind power; Germany"

This paper explores how innovative tools, including blockchain, economic incentives, and gamification, encourage consumer adoption of a novel household waste management system. We focus on developing a comprehensive framework that combines UTAUT2 (the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2) with novel features in the waste management context and additional behavioral construct, intention to recommend the system to others. We tested the proposed model using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach based on a survey of 400 respondents. The results indicate that in addition to effort expectancy, social influence, and hedonic motivation, trust, a property of blockchain technology, also impacts the respondent’s behavioral intention to use the new system. Furthermore, trust has a significant effect on both the level of system use and intention to recommend waste management system to others. The role of gamification was identified as a moderator between behavioral intention and system use and between trust and system use but not between system use and facilitating conditions. This result demonstrates that gamification can be valuable to increase adoption in users with otherwise low levels of behavioral intention. However, we did not find a strong link between either economic incentives, facilitating conditions, or performance expectancy and behavioral intention. The paper concludes by presenting the application of the proposed framework and the implications for the design of future consumer-facing waste management systems. The introduction of the novel features such as blockchain and gamification is discussed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Gamification; Recycling; Technology adoption; UTAUT2; Waste management system","Blockchain; Economic and social effects; Waste management; Behavioral intention; Block-chain; Economic incentive; Gamification; Recycling; System use; Technology adoption; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Waste management systems"

Solar power systems have emerged as a popular choice for both individuals and companies. Despite the country’s energy crisis and reliance on fossil fuels, the adoption rate of solar power systems in Pakistan remains slow. This research aims to develop a cost-effective model that can help consumers in Pakistan adopt solar power systems. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) served as the foundation for this research, which is used to understand and predict individuals’ acceptance of new technology. This study included an internet-based survey conducted among 200 respondents in the southern region of Pakistan. Deductive reasoning was used to analyse the data, and the structural equation model was utilised through SmartPLS 3 software to test the research hypothesis. The survey results revealed that effort expectancy and performance expectancy were not significantly associated with attitude towards use. However, all other factors, such as environmental belief, social influence, hedonic motivation, price value, and facilitating conditions used in the model, have positive and significant influences on the use of solar technology. The findings of this project also enable government and private sector organisations to optimise their planning and resources to promote environment-friendly energy, and they should work on significant factors such as cost, which is one of the most dominant indicators that can attract consumers to shift towards alternate energy resources. This study presents the first attempt to model the intention and behaviour of Pakistani consumers towards using solar technology with the help of UTAUT2. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","consumer intention; Pakistan; solar power system; structure equation modelling; UTAUAT2 model","energy resource; fossil fuel; government; perception; private sector; public attitude; questionnaire survey; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis; Pakistan"

However, its significance as a delivery tool in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) motorcycle industry lacks literature. Motorcycles for product delivery are one of SSA's largest informal employments to generational cohorts. Motorcycles are crucial for product mobility and passenger conveyance in SSA, and it is currently the most outsourced logistics that drive the SSA online commerce ecosystem. With the financial challenges of the SSA motorcycle industry, generational cohorts of this economic sector have adopted social media technology for delivery purposes. Even though this phenomenon is realized among the predominated Generation (Gen) X, Y, and Z, no research has explored the area. However, motorcycle studies are based on actors, organizations, politics, forms of service regulation, safety, health, environmental impacts, and spatial patterns, creating a significant gap in social media adoption, usage, and importance. Therefore, the study aims to assess the effects of the factors influencing the recent adoption of social media technology for delivery operations and the difference in social media acceptance and application between Gen X, Y, and Z in the SSA motorcycle industry using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The novel findings show the theoretical extension of the adopted theories by introducing cohorts' technical know-how (TKH), which positively influences cohorts' social media adoption and application. It also confirms the differences in generational cohorts' technology intelligence and acceptance. Generally, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude influence generational cohorts to adopt social media for delivery purposes. Cohorts' perceived risk was insignificant, and the predictors of the TAM and TPB model partially mediate the positive relationship between TKH and intention to use social media as a delivery tool. The study's findings have theoretical and business implications, which are discussed in detail in the conclusion. But generally, the findings will service as a guide for logistics companies to integrate a cost-effective technology into their system.

These technologies might have positive or negative impacts on sustainable development. While IS theories, such as TAM, UTAUT, and UTAUT2, have provided invaluable insights into the determinants of technology adoption and use, they overlooked the subsequent impacts of technology use. From the sustainability perspective, this necessitates a holistic theoretical framework that goes beyond existing IS theories/models by examining the direct effect of technology use on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Therefore, we developed the Technology-Environmental, Economic, and Social Sustainability Theory (T-EESST) in this research. T-EESST extends beyond existing IS theories by linking technology use to the three dimensions of sustainability. Due to its inclusivity of all facets of sustainability, the Metaverse is selected as a case study to evaluate the T-EESST. The data collected from a survey of 311 Metaverse users provided empirical support for T-EESST. The results showed that technology use significantly impacts environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The T-EESST contributes significantly to the IS and sustainability literature by bridging the gap between technology acceptance models and sustainability.

Understanding the psychological factors that determine the acceptability of ecologically more sustainable systems is crucial for the development of theoretically and empirically derived measures to minimize the risk of the public's rejection of such food production methods. Therefore, a questionnaire study was conducted using the multitrophic interconnected food production system CUBES Circle as object of investigation. CUBES Circle is a research project investigating an innovative farming technique that combines hydro- and aquaculture with insect farming in a controlled environment. A structural model was proposed based on the Technology Acceptance Framework and evaluated using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Data collection was carried out in two waves: The first was used for scale development (N = 305) and the second for SEM (N = 485). Due to an unsatisfactory model fit of the initial model, it was adjusted based on theory- and data-driven considerations. The resulting model had a good model fit in both independent samples. The most important determinants of acceptance intentions were the perceived problem-solving efficacy of the technology (outcome efficacy), believed social pressure from relevant people (subjective norm), positive affect towards the technology and the trust in the stakeholders. This implies, for example, that stakeholders and policy makers aiming to increase acceptance are advised to focus on conveying the concrete way of how the technology is more sustainable instead of merely drawing attention to the problems associated with current food production methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance; Circular agriculture; Innovative food production system; Public perception","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Farms; Food supply; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Acceptance; Circular agriculture; Food production; Food production systems; Food-production technologies; Innovative food production system; Production methods; Psychological factors; Public perception; Structural equation models; Conveying"

In response, this study explores instructors' perceptions about the role of online proctoring as a tool for their courses with the intent of enhancing the understanding of online proctoring's usefulness in ensuring academic integrity and the factors that may be swaying instructors' adoption decisions. An online survey was completed by 158 instructors at a variety of higher education institutions with 118 responding to an open-ended question that allowed respondents to share any additional thoughts about or experiences with using online proctoring. A thematic review of the qualitative comments illustrates the multifaceted impact of online proctoring on instructors and students. Results identified instructors' perceived benefits and challenges of online proctoring to them, their students and the learning process. In addition, instructors voiced numerous legal, ethical and social concerns about the use of online proctoring, including concerns related to students' privacy. Despite these concerns, some instructors identified strong use cases for online proctoring while others provided alternative strategies for ensuring academic integrity in online courses. As institutions consider the role of online proctoring in ensuring academic integrity, a holistic approach that balances instructional design best practices, student-friendly policies and proctoring tools is recommended to serve the complex needs and concerns of instructors, students and their institutions. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Prior research findings are mixed as to whether proctoring is valuable for ensuring academic integrity in online courses. Studies investigating grade performance in proctored versus unproctored exam settings have conflicting results; however, studies have found that students completing proctored formative exams perform better on summative exams than students completing non-proctored formative exams. What this paper adds Qualitative data were collected to provide an overview of instructors' perceptions about and experiences with online proctoring. Analysis suggests that online proctoring is beneficial to some instructors, students and the overall learning process. At the same time, its use is also concerning to other instructors and students. Among the issues raised by instructors are concerns for student privacy, increases in student test anxiety and discriminatory proctoring practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Institutions must be proactive in ensuring that the use of online proctoring aligns with their institutional values and the changing legal landscape. Institutional policies should strive to find a balance between ensuring academic integrity and promoting a positive experience for students and instructors. Since there are strong use cases for online proctoring, these policies should include flexibility whenever possible. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","academic integrity; online examinations; online learning; online proctoring; remote testing; technology acceptance","Acceptance tests; E-learning; Learning systems; Academic integrity; Instructor perceptions; Learning process; Online course; Online environments; Online examinations; Online learning; Online proctoring; Remote testing; Technology acceptance; Students"

Findings: In a low social crowding environment, consumers prefer chatbots with a social-oriented (vs. task-oriented) conversational style, while in a high social crowding environment, consumers prefer a task-oriented (vs. social-oriented) conversational style, and warmth and competence mediate these effects. The moderating effect of product categories is supported. Originality/value: This study expands the application of the stereotype content model to improve the interaction experience level between consumers and chatbots in online retail. The findings can provide managerial suggestions for retailers to select a chatbot's conversational style and promote a more continuous interaction between consumers and chatbots. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chatbots; Conversational styles; Human–computer interaction; Product categories; Social crowding; Social perceptions",""

This study empirically investigates the intention of Korean travelers to use airport biometric systems. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was employed to explore users’ perceptions of the system’s functional aspects, while technology familiarity, social influence, and trust in information protection were integrated into the model to understand users’ psychological aspects. The results reveal that perceived usefulness and ease of use have a positive relationship with the intention to use the biometric system and that perceived ease of use positively influences perceived usefulness. The impact of social influence and technology familiarity was not statistically significant but trust emerged as the most influential factor determining the intention to use the system. Furthermore, the study identified that gender moderates the effect of trust on the intention to use. This study contributes by identifying key determinants for airport biometric system adoption and by investigating the moderating influence of gender. As a primary result, airport biometric systems must have effective functionality and a user-friendly passenger environment while ensuring confidence in system security.

Drawing on career ecosystem and career sustainability theories, we explore factors that lead to career success and career sustainability of visually impaired individuals. We collected qualitative data from 66 visually impaired individuals from India who had experienced varying degrees of career attainment. We applied grounded theory to study their deep-seated attitudes and ingrained behaviors that help build successful and sustainable careers. High-career-attainment participants were extremely resilient, able to bounce back after rejection, and willing to adopt certain key psycho-social processes such as non-acceptance of rejection, relatability (forging positive relations with the sighted), family support, enabling self through technology, and influence mindset change, which led them to be ‘masters of circumstance.’ Conversely, the characteristics of low-career-attainment participants included their unquestioning acceptance of fate, higher degrees of skepticism, and obligation to support the family, which led them to become ‘victims of circumstance.’ We contribute to the career ecosystems and career sustainability literature by expanding it to wider populations and crystalizing processes that influence careers. The findings have policy implications for visually impaired individuals as well as for other people with disabilities, as well as for organizations and governments. Individuals should challenge conventional norms, be persistent and improve self-efficacy. Organization should think out of the box in order to win the war for talent by employing hidden talent. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","career ecosystem; career success; career sustainability; disability; visual impairment",""

The model explained 60.3% of the variance in consumers’ attitudes toward food irradiation and 55.4% of their behavioral intentions toward irradiated ground beef. Attitude had the largest positive, total effect on consumers’ behavioral intentions, which was followed by subjective social norm and perceived benefit. Perceived risk had the largest negative, total effect on behavioral intentions. Attitude mediated the effect of subjective social norm, perceived benefit, perceived risk, objective knowledge, and food technology neophobia.

Specifically, the paper examines attitudes and perceptions towards residential wood burning, commercial-scale wood boilers for heat, combined heat and power (CHP) facilities, and industrial power generation in Michigan. In 2021, we conducted a state-wide survey (n = 207) and 30 semi-structured interviews with individuals representing different stakeholder perspectives, including regulatory agencies, biomass industry leaders, non-governmental organizations and scientists who have shaped biomass debates, forest products workers, and Michigan residents. Results suggest that the depth of an individual's knowledge about different types of wood energy applications generally led to more positive attitudes, particularly for smaller-scale uses of wood for heat. Despite perceived environmental, economic, and human health risks of using wood for different energy applications, across all stakeholder groups, 70% of respondents perceived environmental benefits, 61% perceived economic benefits, and 57% perceived health benefits. Changing economic and environmental conditions in different parts of the state contributed to people's attitudes toward different forms of wood energy and their perceptions of associated risks and benefits. A key recommendation of this study is that policy-makers and energy developers seek to understand the complex factors that influence social acceptance when planning for the adoption of new types of wood-based bioenergy technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioenergy; Public perceptions; Social acceptability; Wood energy","Biomass; Cogeneration plants; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Lakes; Risk perception; Wood; Attitudes and perceptions; Bio-energy; Energy applications; Energy technologies; Great Lakes regions; Michigan; Public perception; Social acceptability; Social acceptance; Wood energy; Health risks; bioenergy; fuelwood; indigenous knowledge; perception; power generation; public attitude; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; wood; Great Lakes [North America]; Midwest; United States"

These emerging industries can benefit local communities but equally can have negative environmental and socio-cultural impacts. The development of new and emerging industries, like deep seabed mining (DSM), requires the acceptance and involvement of local communities. Yet, the history of marine exploitation is imbued with conflicts between industries and local communities. This paper presents a DSM case study in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to stimulate debate around the potential for conflict in the pursuit of resource extraction from the deep sea and the social and environmental harm that these extractions can cause. We do so by first presenting a timeline of local and extra-local events and enabling conditions that form the development background for the DSM Solwara 1 project in PNG. We then undertake a media narrative analysis to consider the contribution of aspects of social acceptability to this highly complex and multi-scale conflict. We find that the lack of (or a decrease in) social acceptability contributed to the conflict situation and ultimately the demise of the Solwara 1 project. Extra-locally, the initial development was positively framed around solutions for decarbonisation using new technology. Over time, actions by international NGOs, financial issues related to foreign companies, and asymmetry in the power balance between the Pacific Island nation and global businesses played a role in growing negative perceptions of acceptability. Historical experiences with prior environmental mining disasters, together with sea tenure governance challenges, and a lack of community and stakeholder acceptance also contributed to the demise of the project. Untangling and debating these complex interactions provides context and reasons for the tension between the lack of societal acceptance at a local scale and the perceived need for DSM products in the global North for innovative technologies and decarbonising societies. Better understanding these interactions and tensions can help emerging industries navigate a future blue economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep sea; Marine conflict; Mining; Papua New Guinea; Social licence","asymmetry; deep sea; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; extraction; local government; mining; stakeholder; Papua New Guinea"

Such improvements include diversifying and scaling up knowledge accessing and sharing through online platforms. We conducted twenty interviews informed by behavioral science methods to clarify the aim, components, and participants' perspectives on the usefulness of the proposed components for an envisioned platform. Participants were members of a Dutch community of practice for river studies and a research programme into integrated and collaborative management. The proposed concept included storylines, data repositories, user profiles, interactive visualisations, and collaborative sessions. Interview results include drivers and barriers from prospective users that we translated into requirements to increase the potential adoption and effective use of online platforms with similar components. From the experiences with implementing these requirements, we provide recommendations for enabling primary drivers: (i) Combining online and offline interactions to provide various options for knowledge exchange between disciplines and organisations. (ii) Sharing the content and application of the research with a non-scientific audience. (iii) Reusing existing online platforms as much as possible without restricting any to improve the reuse of research methods and results. We further provide recommendations to overcome the main barriers: (i) Partnering with various communities to extend knowledge exchange. (ii) Following a participatory approach to improve the design and content while considering the time and resources that such a process entails. (iii) Providing flexible options to contribute and tailor overviews of available knowledge in different ways according to prospective users' roles in practice.

Virtual communities, popular forums for communication and entertainment, increasingly affected the users’ decisions. Though many technology adoption models/theories are available, a distinctive model for decision-making in a virtual environment is scarce. This research developed the virtual communities’ decision model and empirically tested its performance. This study examined 16 well-established theories/models of information technology, social science, marketing, and behavioral finance and extracted nine constructs from 58 identified constructs considering theoretical cohesiveness along with the three-stage method proposed by Moore and Benbasat. A unified model for virtual communities’ decisions (VCDM) is developed and validated using the data collected from individual capital market investors in Bangladesh. The structural equation modeling technique is used to analyze the data. The upshot implies that VCDM performs adequately and explains the maximum variances in intention to decision and investment. VCDM also outperforms the majority of the related theoretical models. The acceptance levels of fit indices and all significant relationships among different constructs are also empirically validated. The moderating effect of the virtual group use experience is also confirmed. Future research can use VCDM in marketing, behavioral finance, ecommerce, information systems and social science context. VCDM thus facilitates a beneficial tool for managers, service providers, and other users to assess the likelihood of effectiveness for decisions in a virtual environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","constructs; covid-19; decision; investors; OSNs; VCDM; virtual communities",""

The main objective of this paper is to explore the direct effects of the industrial Internet of things and supply chain visibility on sustainable performance (economic performance, environmental performance and social performance), in addition to evaluating the indirect effects that supply chain visibility plays in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the purposes and objectives of this work, a conceptual model was developed by referring to the current works in the literature, and the theoretical model was developed, and then data were collected through the questionnaire and by the snowball sampling method, as 380 questionnaires were used. In the data analysis, the multivariate analysis technique was used via Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM), as hypothesized relationships were evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and then the hypotheses were tested through a structural model. Findings: The results reached the acceptance of all hypotheses, and this means that all hypothesized relationships were positive, as the impact of the industrial Internet of things was positive on each of the supply chain visibility and economic performance, environmental performance and social performance, and also the supply chain visibility mediated the relationship between each of the industrial Internet of things and economic performance, environmental performance and social performance. Originality/value: The current paper reported a range of theoretical and practical contributions, as this study is the first to examine these hypothesized relationships together in this way and thus helped this study to develop new perceptions about Industry 4.0 technologies and their potential impacts on supply chain and sustainable performance. Also, this study had a variety of management recommendations that allow managers of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies operating in Jordan to develop their technological capabilities and use them to enhance sustainable performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic performance; Environmental performance; Industrial Internet of things; Social performance; Supply chain visibility",""

Under the target of “dual carbon”, the urgency and importance of effective classification and recycling of express packaging waste cannot be ignored. Based on the unified theory of technology acceptance and use (UTAUT) model and the characteristics of express packaging, this study selected performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and perceived value as core variables, and gender, age and frequency as moderating variables, and established a structural equation through survey and analysis to study the factors influencing consumers’ willingness to recycle express packaging. The results of the study showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and perceived value had a significant positive effect on consumers’ willingness to classify. Classification willingness had a significant positive effect on consumers’ classification behavior. In addition to directly influencing classification intention, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence also have mediating effects.

However, there has been limited research on the impact of social media (SM) on consumers' intentions to make green purchases. The purpose of this study is to confirm a structural model and prove the impact of social media on altruistic, egoistic, and consumer intentions. Additionally, the study observe how green attitude affects these relationships as a moderator. We used a questionnaire-based approach and received 254 original responses from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Statistical data was analyzed using a Path analysis approach. The results established the influence of social media on consumer intention as well as altruistic and egoistic values. Besides, altruistic and egoistic values exerted a significant impact on green purchase intention. Results demonstrate a stronger level of acceptance of altruistic value. In addition, attitude had a direct positive influence on intention and exerted a substantial moderating effect between independent constructs and green purchase intention. Overall, the study suggests that SM play a crucial role in shaping consumer choice including their intention in the decision-making process. This study emphasizes the importance for marketers to share information about environmentally friendly products on social media, using e-marketing strategies. It's also crucial to engage with social media communities by providing both altruistic and egoistic information about sustainable purchasing. The research has important implications for practitioners in this field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altruistic and egoistic motivation; Attitude; Purchase intention; Social media; Theory of planned behaviour",""

The present study explores the level and determinants of citizens' general and local acceptance of two technologies (biorefineries and aquaponics) in two regions (a transition and a non-transition region). Furthermore, the relevance of key determinants, – more specifically social trust, affect, and perceived benefits and risks – in predicting acceptance are explored using partial-least-squares structural equation modeling. In total, 1989 participants from the transition region Rheinische Revier and other non-transition regions of the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia completed the online survey. The results show considerable consistency across the investigated contexts regarding the importance of the behavioral constructs in explaining citizens’ technology acceptance, confirming the derived conceptual framework. Our findings also reveal a lower local acceptance of both biorefineries and aquaponics when compared to general acceptance rates, pointing to the so-called NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) effect. Moreover, local acceptance was lower in the transition region, underlining the particular need for effective communication and participation strategies in those regions to successfully implement a sustainable bioeconomy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affective evaluation; Aquaponics; Benefit-risk perception; Bioeconomy transition; Biorefineries; PLS-SEM","Least squares approximations; Refining; Affective evaluation; Aquaponic; Benefit-risk perception; Benefit/risk; Bio-based; Bioeconomy transition; Biorefineries; Local acceptance; PLS-SEM; Transition regions; Risk perception; biotechnology; conceptual framework; local participation; participatory approach; strategic approach; sustainability; technological development; technology adoption; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia"

Methods: By using the Scrub Nurse Non-Technical Skills Training System (SunSet), we developed a methodology enabling the adaptation of a virtual reality-based environment and scenarios from French to Japanese cultural and medical practices. We then conducted a technical feasibility study between France and Japan to assess virtual reality simulations acceptance among scrub nurses. Results: Results in term of acceptance do not reveal major disparity between both populations, and the only emerging significant difference between both groups is on the Behavioral Intention, which is significantly higher for the French scrub nurses. In both cases, participants had a positive outlook.

Therefore, the emerging BCT can present an invaluable opportunity for the organisations in need of preparing for and responding to uncertain and complex instances. The adoption of BCT in the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) literature remains scarcely investigated, especially in the context of managing risks in emergency situations such as crises, disasters, and pandemics, which are characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) in the business environment. This article will contribute to the OSCM literature by developing a conceptual model that will examine the causal relationships between VUCA business environment, constructs derived from technology acceptance model (TAM), resilience and behavioural intention of the operations managers to adopt BCT for risk management. The model was tested by gathering responses from 116 operations managers in the UK (during COVID-19 pandemic) through structural equation modelling. Findings from the analysis suggest that understanding the benefits of BCT, involvement in resilient organisational practices and user-friendly implementation of the technology will have a significant and positive influence on the intention to adopt BCT for risk management in the OSCM context.

This paper aims to analyse the user acceptability of blockchain technology in enabling EHR exchange and to formulate practical implications for increasing user acceptability. Design/methodology/approach: A technology acceptance model [extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model] was used as a framework to measure the effects of 13 factors. The authors conducted a survey and analysed data from 214 participants using partial least square path modelling. Findings: The acceptance of blockchain for EHR sharing is positively influenced by performance expectancy, social influence and perceived trust. Effort expectancy and facilitating conditions do not influence acceptance. The UTAUT model explains the variance in acceptance at 58.4%. Self-efficacy influences effort expectancy, incentives influence facilitating conditions and security predicts perceived trust. Practical implications: Three implications are drawn: (1) Users need to clearly understand system’s purpose, functions, security mechanism and environmental impacts. (2) Users are incentivised to share health data via a blockchain solution if the technology offers personalising options and health information. (3) Health personnel can socially impact patients to use blockchain-based solutions. Originality/value: Studies have shown that blockchain technology is a valuable solution for exchanging EHR. The novelty of this work is to identify how and why patients may accept this emerging technology for EHR exchange. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain acceptability; Blockchain data exchange; E-health data; EHR; Electronic health record; Federated data; Technology acceptance model; UTAUT","Blockchain; Economic and social effects; eHealth; Environmental impact; Records management; Block-chain; Blockchain acceptability; Blockchain data exchange; E health; E-health data; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Federated data; Health data; Health records; Technology acceptance model; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Electronic data interchange"

Such a transition is only possible if consumers are willing to accept foods produced using novel technologies. Previous research on consumer acceptance has generally focused on individual technologies in isolation, rendering comparisons across studies difficult, and mostly considered average acceptance without devoting attention to individual differences among consumers. Additionally, available data overwhelmingly pertained to European and North American consumers, whereas much less is known about consumer perception in non-Western countries. Against this backdrop, this study examined consumer acceptance and perception of a wide range of novel, sustainable food technologies in four countries (Australia, India, Singapore, and the USA, N = 2494 in total) using survey methodology. For each technology, willingness-to-consume (WTC, operationalized as expected frequency of consumption), emotional associations, and situational appropriateness responses were collected. All measures revealed major differences in consumer perception of novel food technologies, identifying three groups: 1) technologies with high consumer acceptance comprising vegetables from urban farming and vegetables packaged in a modified atmosphere; 2) technologies with medium consumer acceptance comprising fish reared in aquaponics systems, plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy, and gene-editing; 3) technologies with low consumer acceptance comprising insect ingredients, cell-cultured meat and cell-cultured fish. Technologies in the high acceptance group were perceived as healthier and apt to move one's diet in a more sustainable direction, whereas consumers had issues associating specific benefits to the less accepted technologies. Cross-cultural differences were identified. Most notably, Indian consumers responded more positively to all novel food technologies, especially compared to consumers in the US and Australia. Finally, four pan-national consumer segments were identified based on their overall patterns of acceptance towards novel food technologies. The segments varied primarily in terms of baseline WTC (low, medium, and high), indicating that consumers tended to accept or reject novel food technologies regardless of their nature. The segment characterized by a high acceptance included only about a fifth of the consumers, showing that WTC towards novel food technologies for most consumers ranged from moderate to outright rejection. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that consumers' general skepticism regarding technologies in the food domain remains a significant challenge towards achieving more sustainable diets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-cultural consumer research; Food technology neophobia; Novel food technologies; Sustainable food systems; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Farms; Fish; Vegetables; Consumer acceptance; Consumer perception; Consumer research; Cross-cultural consumer research; Food system; Food technology neophobium; Novel food technology; Novel foods; Sustainable food system; Technology adoption; Sustainable development"

Nonetheless, very little is known about how traditional animal farmers perceive these new products, despite being directly impacted by their advance. The present study explored the views of livestock farmers regarding emerging protein alternatives. We used a comparison group of omnivorous non-farmers as a frame of reference. Forty-five UK-based livestock farmers and fifty-three non-farmers read an informative vignette about emerging food technologies that reviewed their advantages vis-à-vis intensive animal agriculture. Afterwards, participants rated four products (plant-based burgers; plant-based milk alternatives; cultured beef; animal-free dairy milk) in terms of their personal appeal and how much they represented a positive change to the market. Participants furthermore voiced their agreement or disagreement towards 26 statements representing potential facilitators or barriers to product acceptance. Overall, farmers rated the four products less appealing and less beneficial to the industry compared to non-farmers. Positive change ratings tended to be higher than personal appeal ratings for all products. Both groups tended to agree that the alternatives offered advantages, particularly for the environment, resource use, food security, and animal treatment, though agreement rates were lower for farmers. Farmers tended to perceive more barriers to acceptance than non-farmers, with ‘threat to farmers’ and ‘lack of support to local farmers’ of paramount concern to both groups. These findings highlight how farmers’ attitudes towards alternative proteins are mixed and, ultimately, shaped by the perceived vulnerability of farming communities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","animal-free dairy; consumer attitudes; cultured meat; farmers; plant-based alternatives","dairy farming; farmers attitude; perception; questionnaire survey; United Kingdom"

Second, it developed a technology-based model to adopt cybersecurity practices in Saudi smart cities. Two surveys were conducted to achieve these objectives. The first survey identified challenges and gaps in adopting cybersecurity practices in smart cities, revealing concerns about weak cybersecurity platforms, privacy breaches, and the impact of IT infrastructure advancements on Saudi culture (N = 554: common public). The second survey focused on developing and validating a cybersecurity-based UTAUT3 model (N = 108: IT professionals), emphasizing nine factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, safety, resiliency, availability, confidentiality, and integrity of cybersecurity. The model’s validity and reliability were assessed, demonstrating its potential for understanding user behavior and adoption patterns in smart cities. The study findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the adoption of cybersecurity measures in smart Saudi cities, highlighting the need for targeted strategies, effective awareness programs, and collaboration between stakeholders to promote a secure and resilient digital environment.

Extending professionals’ competencies to promote precision farming practices can increase the adoption rate, ultimately impacting food security. Many studies have addressed barriers to the adoption of precision farming technologies from the farmers’ perspective. However, few are available data on the perspectives of extension professionals. Agricultural extension professionals play an important role in innovative agricultural technology adoption. Thus, this study applied four constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to investigate behavioral intentions to promote precision farming among extension professionals from two extension systems. In total, 102 (N = 102) agricultural extension professionals were surveyed. The results indicated that performance expectancy and social influence were individually significant predictors of extension professional behavioral intentions to promote precision farming technologies. There were no significant differences between the professionals of two extension systems. Gender, age, and years of service did not affect extension professionals’ intention to promote precision agriculture technologies. The data suggested the need for training programs to develop advanced competencies to promote agricultural innovation. This study contributes to the future professional development programs for extension professionals on communicating innovations to address food security and sustainability issues. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","change agents; innovative agricultural practices; performance expectancy; professional development programs; social influence; UTAUT model",""

As governments play a crucial role in determining energy and environmental policy, developing practical policymaking tools encourages them to stimulate the adoption of renewable energy technology. This study proposes a novel framework to model an energy system transition focused on the power generation and its dynamic behavior of fossil-fuel-rich countries using the System Dynamics (SD) approach and then assesses the techno-economic and environmental impacts of various economic, technical, and environmental policies using the Multi-Criteria Decision-Analysis technique (MCDA). This study aims to compare the development of renewable technologies development versus improving the current technology efficiency under three different “business as usual,” “basic development,” and “advanced development” scenarios by assessing economic, environmental, and social indicators over the horizon of 2016–2040 in fossil-rich-fuel countries. The proposed framework was applied to Iran, a fossil-fuel-rich country. According to the case study results, in all of the defined policies under three scenarios, the improvement of fossil fuel technologies received the highest score indicating that improvement in the efficiency of the current energy system by utilizing combined cycle systems is an inevitable step. Taking into account the water shortage in Iran, the second crucial stage is the implementation of water-efficient renewable technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","And social nexus; Energy; Energy system modeling; Energy transition; Environment; Policymaking; Power generation; Sustainability","adaptive management; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; decision analysis; efficiency measurement; energy planning; energy policy; feasibility study; fossil fuel; governance approach; multicriteria analysis; policy making; power generation; technological development; technology adoption; Iran"

Researching the intention to use air vehicles is not easy, as it is a new mode of transport that has not yet been implemented, so there are no available observed data. This fact is why the many gaps and uncertainties remain unexplored in academic research on this topic. The most critical issues for the successful implementation of a UAM transport system is public acceptance and user adoption. Based on technology adoption theories, this paper investigates critical constructs in generating usage intention to use urban air autonomous vehicles (UAAVs) and the mediator role of pro-environmental behavior and human values in this relationship. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used with a sample from the US and China. The results confirm that attitudes, performance expectancy, and social influence reinforce the intention to use UAAVs, while anxiety reduces it. The UAAV acceptance model is very similar between the Chinese and US populations. The only difference between the two samples is that social influence has a positive and significant effect on intention to use among US people. At the same time, this variable is not essential in the Chinese sample. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covariance-based structural equation modeling; Human values; Intention to use; Pro-environmental behavior; Urban air autonomous vehicles","Air mobility; Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Urban transportation; Autonomous Vehicles; Behavioral intention; Covariance-based structural equation modeling; Human values; Intention to use; Pro-environmental behaviors; Social influence; Structural equation models; Urban air; Urban air autonomous vehicle; Autonomous vehicles; air transportation; environmentalism; numerical model; regression analysis; technology adoption; unmanned vehicle; China; United States"

However, developing countries were seen to underutilize this product where research showed that the economic, societal, and environmental concerns were considered by consumers. The current study aimed to assess the behavioral intentions for purchasing hybrid cars with the use of an established new framework called sustainability theory of planned behavior (STPB) and integrated with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model. A total of 1048 valid respondents were purposely gathered to completely assess the behavioral, technological, and sustainable domains of purchasing intentions of hybrid cars through structural equation modeling. From the results, the perceived economic concerns and perceived authority support showed the most significant factor indirectly affecting behavioral intention to purchase hybrid cars, followed by perceived environmental concern. All domains under the theory of planned behavior were significant. However, only performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value were deemed significant on the technological aspect. With the underutilization of hybrid cars in the country, habit, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions were insignificant. The theoretical framework can be used independently (STPB), or as a whole, for the evaluation of purchasing intention of eco-friendly or smart technologies products. This study was also able to provide implications on the behavioral, managerial, and sustainability aspects of hybrid cars. Lastly, the theoretical implications suggested that the sustainability theory of planned behavior may be extended or applied in holistically assessing different product evaluation, industries, and related studies—even in different countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavioral intentions; hybrid cars; sustainability; sustainability theory of planned behavior; UTAUT2","antecedent conditions; automobile; numerical model; sustainability; theoretical study"

As middle-aged and elderly people get older, their physical functions gradually decline, and increasing problems with moving around become an important factor preventing them from leading active lives. The popularity of smart cars is going to play an important part in solving this problem. This makes it all the more important to have an accurate understanding of the attitude of middle-aged and elderly people via-à-vis smart cars, and to take those attitudes into consideration when designing, developing and promoting smart cars. Based on a large number of literature reviews and technology acceptance extension models like TAM and UTAUT, this study proposed and tested a model of the acceptance of smart cars amongst middle-aged and elderly people (MSCTAM) that includes external variables. Other factors that determined whether middle-aged and elderly people in China would accept smart cars were also taken into account. In terms of model verification, we used SEM of SPSS AMOS for fit indices and aggregation validity analysis. The hypothesis test part was based on model fit indices, discriminant validity and path analysis, while power analysis, using Python, was also conducted. The Wilcoxon's Sign Rank Test of SPPS was used for acceptance. For data collection, we mainly used a combination of online and offline questionnaire surveys, with subjects from various provinces and cities in China. A total of 293 questionnaires was collected, and 262 valid responses were obtained. The results showed that the attitudes towards use, perceived usefulness, enjoyment and social norms were significantly positively correlated with usage intention, while trust was positively correlated with usage intention. Affordability was negatively correlated with usage intention, perceived ease of use; reliability was significantly positively correlated with perceived usefulness; enjoyment was significantly positively correlated with perceived ease of use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, personal innovation, and environment-friendliness. Symbolic value was significantly positively correlated with attitudes towards use, while safety risks and privacy risks were negatively correlated with attitudes towards use. Of the 16 hypotheses, 12 were supported, indicating that middle-aged and elderly people in China on the one hand have a positive and open attitude towards smart cars, but on the other, also have a number of concerns. The proposed model provides more refined survey models and data support for Chinese smart car developers and manufacturers, and furnishes them with references for the research field of technology acceptance models. The proposed model provides Chinese intelligent automobile development companies and distributors with a more refined survey model and data support, and offers references and guidance for further research of technology acceptance models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptability; Middle-aged and elderly; Smart car; Technology acceptance model (TAM)","Acceptance tests; Behavioral research; Python; Acceptability; Elderly people; Fit indexes; Middle-aged and elderly; Perceived ease-of-use; Perceived usefulness; Smart car; Technology acceptance model; Usage intention; Regression analysis; adult; elderly population; numerical model; public attitude; survey; technology adoption; China"

In this regard, FinTech applications such as mobile financial service (MFS) play an essential role in building resilience during the pandemic. Hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of MFS platforms in economic resilience by empirically evaluating the determinants that influence the intention of Bangladeshi users toward adopting MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, through an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Using the core structures of the UTAUT, the theoretical model was constructed based on the consumption attributes of financial services such as perceived value, as well as additional situational factors from the extended valence framework, including risk and trust. To test the model, data was obtained from 227 potential MFS users in Bangladesh with the aid of a structured questionnaire survey. Subsequently, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the data. The findings showed that social influence, perceived trust, and perceived value are strongly related to the intention of users to adopt MFS platforms, whereas, perceived risk, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy were observed to influence users’ perceived value of the MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the study results indicated that the users’ perceived risk did not influence their intention to adopt MFS platforms during the pandemic. Therefore, the suggested adoption of the MFS framework during and after the pandemic could contribute to the existing research on the adoption of information technology (IT) through the expansion of the UTAUT, in which the performance and effort expectancy of users influence their intention to indirectly adopt MFS through perceived value. Finally, the significant policy implications and future research directions are further addressed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bangladesh; COVID-19; FinTech; IT adoption; Mobile financial service (MFS); Perceived value; UTAUT","COVID-19; economic impact; environmental factor; financial services; information technology; model test; risk perception; technology adoption; Bangladesh; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; human; pandemic; patient attitude; questionnaire; theoretical model; Humans; Intention; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires"

In countries historically reliant on natural gas for domestic heating and cooking such as the UK, hydrogen may prove critical to meeting net-zero targets and strengthening energy security. In response, the UK government is targeting industrial decarbonization via hydrogen, with parallel interest in deploying hydrogen-fueled appliances for businesses and homes. However, prospective hydrogen futures, and especially the domestic hydrogen transition, face multiple barriers which reflect the cross-sectoral dynamics of achieving economies of scale and social acceptance. Addressing these challenges calls for a deep understanding of socio-technical factors across different scales of the hydrogen economy. In response, this paper develops a socio-technical systems framework for overcoming barriers to the domestic transition, which is applied to the UK context. The paper demonstrates that future strategies should account for interactions between political, techno-economic, technical, market, and social dimensions of the hydrogen transition. In parallel to techno-economic feasibility, the right policies will be needed to create an even playing field for green hydrogen technologies, while also supporting stakeholder symbiosis and consumer buy-in. Future studies should grapple with how an effective repurposing of pipelines, policies, and public perceptions can be aligned to accelerate the development of the hydrogen economy, with maximum net benefits for society and the environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decarbonization; Domestic hydrogen transition; Public perceptions; Socio-technical systems; Techno-economic barriers","Binary alloys; Decarbonization; Economics; Pipelines; Decarbonisation; Domestic hydrogen transition; Energy transitions; Global energy; Hydrogen economy; Public perception; Repurposing; Socio-technical barriers; Sociotechnical systems; Techno-economic barriers; Energy security; government; natural gas; perception; pipeline; policy approach; stakeholder; strategic approach; United Kingdom"

This is particularly problematic when policymakers are planning to enact top-down policies to promote BIM adoption in public-funded construction. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish the industry-level factors that constraint or enable actors' intention to adopt BIM. Design/methodology/approach: Using institutional theory with an emphasis on the cultural-cognitive elements, the authors aim to complement the understanding of BIM adoption by incorporating institutional elements into the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The cultural-cognitive elements were extracted from focus groups and interviews with architecture, construction and engineering (AEC) professionals in Peru. A modified UTAUT was empirically tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) with a dataset from 171 questionnaire responses. Findings: The industry characteristics, standardisation, affordability and technology/methodology definition of BIM were found to be the cultural-cognitive elements having direct effects on individual reactions to BIM. These findings suggest that BIM adoption policies should focus on designing incentives schemes, training/educating professionals on BIM collaborative processes and developing/adapting applicable standards. However, a BIM adoption mandate would require policymakers to create collaborative procurement environments in tandem with information management and process standards. Practical implications: Findings can be used by policymakers to significantly promote BIM adoption in contexts without a government mandate for public sector construction. Originality/value: The study of institutional elements on BIM adoption is still limited. This study provides empirical evidence on how the cultural-cognitive elements of the industry context are associated with actors' intention to adopt BIM. Therefore, this study bridges industry and individual levels of analysis. Furthermore, this study enables policymakers to initiate actions that significantly encourage BIM adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modelling; Construction industry; Cultural-cognitive elements; Institutions; Peru","Architectural design; Factor analysis; Information management; Information theory; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Cognitive elements; Cultural-cognitive element; Empirical studies; Industry contexts; IS planning; Peru; Policy makers; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Construction industry"

To realise the potential of autonomous buses in public transportation, understanding the public's intention to use the new technology-based mobility concept is necessary. Therefore, this study synthesises three theories to explain public intention to use autonomous buses, namely, unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT), task technology fit (TTF) theory and trust theory. A survey instrument (n = 277) is adopted to validate the theoretical model. The results indicate that (1) performance expectancy (e.g., economic benefits, environmental friendliness and safety), effort expectancy (e.g., ease to use, availability and accessibility), social influence (e.g., attitudes of around people and information from society) and perceived risk (e.g., injuries, damages and privacy issues) lead to the formation of trust; and (2) trust has direct and indirect (via TTF) effects on behavioural intention to use autonomous buses. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis is conducted, and the significance of the mediation effect of TTF is verified.

Building on previous work on trust in people and technology, we advance a multidimensional, multilevel conceptualization of trust in AI and examine the relationship between trust and ethics using the data from a survey of a national sample in the U.S. This paper offers two key dimensions of trust in AI—human-like trust and functionality trust—and presents a multilevel conceptualization of trust with dispositional, institutional, and experiential trust each significantly correlated with trust dimensions. Along with trust in AI, we examine perceptions of the importance of seven ethics requirements of AI offered by the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group. Then the association between ethics requirements and trust is evaluated through regression analysis. Findings suggest that the ethical requirement of societal and environmental well-being is positively associated with human-like trust in AI. Accountability and technical robustness are two other ethical requirements, which are significantly associated with functionality trust in AI. Further, trust in AI was observed to be higher than trust in other institutions. Drawing from our findings, we offer a multidimensional framework of trust that is inspired by ethical values to ensure the acceptance of AI as a trustworthy technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethics requirements of AI; Public perceptions of AI; Trust in AI","Regression analysis; Ethic requirement of artificial intelligence; Ethical implications; European Commission; Human like; Key dimensions; Multilevels; Public perception; Public perception of artificial intelligence; Trust dimensions; Trust in artificial intelligence; Ethical technology"

The model is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which has been decomposed to account for key components of the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory and extended to include other influential attitudinal components (such as driving-related sensation seeking, safety perceptions, environmental concerns, and affinity to innovativeness). The extent to which these factors are expected to affect the diffusion of AVs uniformly across different urban settings is also examined. Data were collected through stated preference surveys targeting adult residents in three metropolitan statistical areas, Chicago (Illinois), Indianapolis (Indiana), and Phoenix (Arizona). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test the validity and reliability of the components included in the theoretical model, followed by the estimation of a multi-group structural equation model. The findings of the measurement model show that the survey questions are measured equally across the three areas, and hence, the theoretical model is transferrable. The results of the structural model suggest that the synergistic effects between TPB and DoI can better explain the behavioral intention to ride in AVs. It was also found that the effect of the TBP components is similar across various areas; however, this is not the case for the DoI components. In general, the findings reinforce the need for wider testing of AV technology in urban areas coupled with public education campaigns to harvest public awareness and acceptance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous vehicles; Behavioral intention; Diffusion of innovation; Public acceptance; Structural equation modeling; Theory of planned behavior","Acceptance tests; Autonomous vehicles; Diffusion; Factor analysis; Surveys; Autonomous Vehicles; Behavioral intention; Diffusion of innovations; Group analysis; Multi-group; Public acceptance; Structural equation models; Theoretical modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; US metropolitan areas; Reliability analysis; assessment method; automation; education; innovation; metropolitan area; psychology; public attitude; social behavior; technology diffusion; theoretical study; transportation planning; transportation safety; transportation technology; urban area; urban transport; Arizona; Chicago; Illinois; Indiana; Phoenix; United States"

The current study analyses the determinants contributing to user acceptance of APT through three theoretical lenses, namely, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Perceived Value Theory and Social Exchange Theory. Survey data were collected from 476 commuters in Beijing, China. The results reveal that the five dimensions of UTAUT (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation) have positive influence on users’ value perception of APT. Consequently, users’ value perception of APT exerts both direct and indirect influences on users’ acceptance of APT via trust. A key contribution of this study is the combination and synthesis of several complementary behavioural theories to explain user acceptance of autonomous vehicles. In addition, the results offer important implications for transport policymakers and operators, in particular, pertaining to areas on resource allocation, marketing, communication and education to improve user acceptance of APT. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance; Automation; Autonomous vehicles; Determinants; Public transport","Economic and social effects; Acceptance; Autonomous Vehicles; Critical mass; Determinant; Environmental benefits; Public transport; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theoretical investigations; Users' acceptance; Value perceptions; Autonomous vehicles; automation; perception; public transport; technology adoption; travel behavior; unmanned vehicle; Beijing [China]; China"

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitioners’ PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitioners’ perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitioners’ perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to explore industry perceptions toward PC technology adoption, providing valuable guidance for the effective diffusion of PC technology and laying a reliable foundation for research on other construction innovation adoption in post-COVID-19. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diffusion of innovation; Innovation adoption; Prefabricated construction technology; Technology acceptance model; Technology–organization–environment","Commerce; Diffusion; Least squares approximations; Social aspects; Adoption behavior; Construction technologies; Diffusion of innovations; Innovation adoption; Multifaceted model; Perceived usefulness; Prefabricated construction technology; Technology organization environments; Technology acceptance model; Technology adoption; Construction industry"

As part of these programs, measures for improving the ecological sustainability of food production play a central role and require the wider implementation of innovative land use systems. Alley cropping agroforestry systems are one example that could, according to recent scientific literature, make an important contribution to resolving the trade-off between economic and ecological sustainability in sparsely forested EU countries such as Germany. However, even today these systems show limited dissemination in agricultural practice, exposing a lack of knowledge about farmers’ profit and subsidy expectations and their main behavioral acceptance drivers in the current political situation. This study aims to close this gap in two ways. Firstly, it assesses farmers’ expectations of economic benefits from planting alley cropping agroforestry systems, and offsets them against national taxpayers’ willingness to pay an annual tax for these systems. Secondly, it quantifies the influence of psycho-social factors that drive farmers to accept alley cropping agroforestry systems as part of their cultivation program. It does this through the empirical application of a case-specific model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Data on farmers’ economic expectations and model constructs were generated during a quantitative survey of 209 farmers in Germany and analyzed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. The descriptive results demonstrate a general rejection of alley cropping agroforestry systems and a low intention to implement them. Farmers prefer subsidy programs to the sale of wooden components as sources of economic benefit, expecting a yearly support of €512 (∼ 606US$) per hectare. Results from the partial least squares analysis show the positive influence of performance expectancy, attitude, and facilitating conditions on the behavioral intention to use an alley cropping agroforestry system, with the latter exerting a positive influence on the final use behavior. Entrepreneurial planning and intuition appear to influence some of the acceptance factors. The results suggest a wide range of implications for policy makers, advocacy groups, and farmers, proposing a focus on creating favorable conditions and positive attitudes among farmers in order to increase agroforestry dissemination. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alley cropping; Germany; Innovation acceptance; Partial least squares estimation; Sustainable land use; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","agricultural land; agricultural worker; agroforestry; cropping practice; innovation; land use; least squares method; sustainability; tax system; willingness to pay; Germany"

The key concerns are the elements that influence academics' behavioral intention to adopt IoT, and how the whole operation affects their performance. However, there is a research gap in past studies that have not addressed this issue sufficiently. As a result, this study employed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a guideline to examine the factors that influence academics' behavioral intentions to use IoT. Furthermore, the moderating effects of both gender and level of experience on this relationship were inspected. The structural models were validated, and the predefined hypotheses were presented (n = 321). The results from the Structural Equation Modeling approach using Amos 26 indicate that performance expectancy, social influence, and effort expectancy directly influenced behavioral intentions to utilize IoT. The findings also showed that facilitating conditions were the most important determinant of academics' actual usage of IoT. The structural model was further investigated according to the experiences of the male and female academic groups. The findings revealed a different pattern of strength and significant relationships between groups with the overall model, implying that gender and experience act as moderators. This study provides a wealth of antecedents from which to construct a thorough theory of IoT adoption. The theory explores the elements that influence academics' willingness to utilize IoT from the standpoints of the technology itself, social context, and individual user characteristics. By employing the proposed approach, Universities can modify their EL strategies to make the most of their resources and in turn improve efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academics; E-Learning; Experience; Gender; IoT adoption; UTAUT",""

Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish the objective, the present study followed mixed-method approach consisting of two phases: In the first qualitative phase, barriers in the adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) for SWM were identified using extensive literature review and discussion with selected experts. In the second phase, the quantitative analysis using the Fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method was performed on the selected barriers. The fuzzy DEMATEL methodology helps in prioritizing the most significant causal barrier by separating them into the cause-effect group. The comparative analysis was used to understand two different perceptions. To provide more detailed insight on the problems faced while implementing SWM in developing economies. Findings: The results disclose that “Lack of government strict regulatory policies,” “Lack of proper financial planning” and “Lack of benchmarking processes” are the most critical causal barriers toward IoT-enabled SWM implementation that are hindering the vision of efficient and effective waste management system. Also, “Difficulty in implementing innovative technologies” and “Absence of Dynamic Scheduling and Routing” fall under the potential causal category. The effect barriers include “Lack of awareness among the community,” “Lack of source segregation and recycling commitment” and “Lack of service provider” as concluded in results considering the comparative analysis. The results can aid the policy-makers and stakeholders to identify the significant barriers toward a sustainable circular economy and mitigate them when implementing IoT-enable waste practices. Also, it assists to proactively build programs, policies, campaigns and other measures to attain a zero-waste economy. Research limitations/implications: The research is focused on the context of India but it provides new details which can be helpful for other developing economies to relate. The research addresses the call for studies from public-sector and citizen’s perspectives to understand the acknowledgment of SWM systems and critical success factors using qualitative and exploratory method analysis. Practical implications: The practical implications of the study include strict regulatory policies and guidelines for SWM acceptance, proper financial administration and benchmarking waste-recycling practices (prominent causal barriers). The practical implication of the results includes assistance in smart city projects in handling barriers proactively. The “Lack of Benchmarking processes” provides a critical application to standardized recycling practices in developing economies to improve the quality of the recyclable material/product. The comparative analysis also provides in-depth reflection toward the causal barriers from both the perspective which can help the government and stakeholders to work in a unified manner and establish an efficient waste management system. The results also conclude the need for targeted training programs and workshops for field implementation of innovative technologies to overcome the causal barrier. Moreover, policy-makers should focus to improve source segregation and recycling practices and ensure dedicated communication campaigns like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to change the behavioral functioning of the community regarding waste. Lastly, developing economies struggle with the adequacy of resources to establish SWM systems, hence the authors conclude that proper financial planning is required at the ground level for smart city projects to overcome the spillover effects. Social implications: The social implications of the study include a reduction in pollution and efficient handling of waste resulting in a healthier and cleaner environment using IoT technology. Also, the results assist decision-makers in developing economies like India to establish smart city projects initiatives effectively to improve the quality of life. It proposes to establish standardized recycling processes for the better quality of recyclables and help in attaining a sustainable circular economy. Originality/value: The research is novel as it provides comprehensive and comparative information regarding the barriers deferring SWM including the field barriers. To our consideration, the present study serves the first to address the comparative analysis of barriers in IoT-enabled waste systems and establish the relationship from both the perspective in middle-lower income economies. The study also suggests that the effect barriers can be overcome automatically by mitigating the causal barriers in the long run. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barriers; DEMATEL; Fuzzy set theory; Smart waste management; Sustainable circular economy","Developing countries; Fuzzy set theory; Internet of things; Waste management; Barrier; Circular economy; Comparative analyzes; Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Decisions makings; Developing economies; Fuzzy-set theory; Smart waste management; Sustainable circular economy; Waste management systems; Decision making; developing world; economics; fuzzy mathematics; perception; sustainability; waste management; India"

However, to prompt the successful deployment of such technologies in diverse societal and market contexts, public acceptance constitutes a crucial requirement. As public knowledge of KETs is often limited, “cognitive shortcuts” – such as attitudes and personal beliefs – play a crucial role in shaping public opinion about enabling technologies. Drawing on the case of nanotechnology, the paper advances that environmental attitudes contribute to shape layman's perceptions about novel enabling technologies. Based on data collected from a survey of Italian citizens, the study investigates the influence of environmental awareness on public perceptions of benefits and risks of nanotechnology. By means of hierarchical regression equations, the study also tests the moderation of public trust in the environmental commitment of societal actors deemed responsible for nanotechnology development – i.e. high-tech companies, governmental agencies and research universities. The results show that environmental awareness positively relates with both perceived benefits and risks of nanotechnology, while the different effects of trust are contingent upon the actor in which trust is put. The contribution of the study point to the role of public trust in shaping perceptions of novel technology: the study's implications for practice thus inform the development of information strategies aimed at supporting the acceptance of KETs among the larger public. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive miser model; Environmental attitudes; Key enabling technologies; Nanotechnology; Public acceptance; Sustainable development","Environmental technology; Nanotechnology; Pollution control; Risk perception; Social aspects; Cleaner production; Cognitive miser model; Enabling technologies; Environmental attitudes; Environmental awareness; Key enabling technology; Public acceptance; Public perception; Public trust; Well being; Sustainable development"

The study was carried out in four European countries, and the sample population covered different age ranges, genders and economic statuses. The main findings are that the most critical factors relate to price, quality and ease of use, but other factors, such as environmental benefits, composition and origin of materials, also affect bio-based products. In addition, this study concludes that most people do not understand some important aspects related to bio-based products, and product information and communication channels need to be improved. Therefore, purchasing strategies for bio-based products should focus on addressing these shortcomings, making the decision to buy bio-based products a quick and easy action. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","absorbent hygiene product; bio-based products; consumers; social acceptance","bioactivity; consumption behavior; decision making; hygiene; information and communication technology; recycling; statistical analysis; Europe"

A robot is an excellent tool to be used in therapy and teaching. It can transform teaching methods, not just in the classrooms but also in the in-house clinical practices. With the rapid advancement in deep learning techniques, robots became more capable of handling human behaviour. In this paper, we present a cost-efficient, socially designed robot called ‘Tinku’, developed to assist in teaching special needs children. ‘Tinku’ is low cost but is full of features and has the ability to produce human-like expressions. Its design is inspired by the widely accepted animated character ‘WALL-E’. Its capabilities include offline speech processing and computer vision—we used light object detection models, such as Yolo v3-tiny and single shot detector (SSD)—for obstacle avoidance, non-verbal communication, expressing emotions in an anthropomorphic way, etc. It uses an onboard deep learning technique to localize the objects in the scene and uses the information for semantic perception. We have developed several lessons for training using these features. A sample lesson about brushing is discussed to show the robot’s capabilities. Tinku is cute, and loaded with lots of features, and the management of all the processes is mind-blowing. It is developed in the supervision of clinical experts and its condition for application is taken care of. A small survey on the appearance is also discussed. More importantly, it is tested on small children for the acceptance of the technology and compatibility in terms of voice interaction. It helps autistic kids using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Autism Spectral disorders are being increasingly identified today’s world. The studies show that children are prone to interact with technology more comfortably than a with human instructor. To fulfil this demand, we presented a cost-effective solution in the form of a robot with some common lessons for the training of an autism-affected child. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism therapy; computer vision; robot design; robot vision; robot–child interaction","Anthropomorphic robots; Deep learning; Diseases; Robot learning; Robot vision; Autism spectrum disorders; Autism therapies; Autism treatments; Clinical practices; Cost effective; Learning techniques; Robot designs; Robot–child interaction; Teaching methods; Technological tools; Semantics"

In our paper, we propose a hybrid theoretical model to analyze the continuance intention to use mobile learning in higher education. The scientific demarche is carried out from different perspectives opened by the models and theories integrated in a unitary approach. In addition to the main constructs taken from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the research model was enriched with new capabilities by considering the Motivational Model (MM), Flow Theory (FT) and the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The research model was applied to the Romanian higher education environment and proved that perceived usefulness (PU), habit (HB), perceived skill (PS), and self-efficacy (SE) directly influence the continuance intention to use (CU) smartphones in higher education. Further, performance expectancy (PFE), intrinsic motivation (IM), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE) indirectly influence the continuance intention to use (CU). We presented our results according to top studies on the critical challenges and factors influencing smart mobile learning success usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we found that Romanian universities provide excellent IT infrastructure and top management support and that creating habits of using m-learning in the context of university classes will strengthen the university culture.

At the same time, the job market nowadays has increasingly depended on technology to recruit new workers, especially in Smart Cities, a concept that has been recently introduced to developing countries. As a result, the use of the Internet for job searches has become increasingly important for older adults living in urban environments, especially those with limited resources. However, there has not been an in-depth paper exploring the various factors that may affect the older population’s ability to use this new development to their advantage. This study offered a closer look at the social and economic factors that influence acceptance of using the Internet to look for a job among older urban poor in Thailand. By understanding the influences that shape their attitudes and behaviors towards online job searches, it is then possible to guide the development of Smart Cities and offer better assistance to older adults who wish to use the Internet for employment opportunities. We applied a logit regression model on data collected from individuals aged pre-retirement and retirement (n = 1505) in two Thai cities with significantly different economic development levels. The results showed that gender, religion, family arrangement, and income had a significant impact on older adults’ online job search activities, especially when it came to women, people of the Islamic faith, people living with partners, and high-income individuals.

The development of CCUS has so far been slow in spite of substantial plans for implementation for example by the European Union. Lack of societal support is among the reasons cited for this gap between ambitions and implementation. Against this background, this paper simultaneously looks into the policy framework as well as stakeholder perceptions of CCUS as indicators for societal support. The focus is on three regions in three different European countries (Ebro Basin, Spain; Paris Basin, France; Upper Silesia, Poland) and a potential implementation of CCUS in these regions. The empirical data this paper draws on consists of 40 stakeholder interviews on the regional and national level. Our analysis points to differences between the countries with France being most advanced. The main driver for the development of CCUS in all three countries is (local) economic benefit by preserving existing or creating new industries. Barriers include costs, potential environmental impacts, and to some extent lack of support from policymakers and the public. © 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, the focus of this article is twofold. First, in this article, we propose a model to investigate the mediating role of awareness in the intention to accept RES. The study consists of a unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology and a set of four hypotheses. Second, an integrated MCDM method is applied based on the entropy TOPSIS to select the optimum RES alternative. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the weight shows the robustness of the proposed integrated model and the public perception of RES is analyzed using sentiment analysis. As a part of a sufficient survey, data were collected from 300 plus people in an urban area of Malaysia and online global reports.

Several challenges may arise when implementing e-learning, including an insufficient budget or problems with adoption. Nevertheless, the role of digitalization is to ensure the university’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, the future of e-learning depends on future generations, which increasingly accept new technologies. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the factors that stimulate university students’ acceptance of technology. Methodology: The study population comprised Romanian university students who took online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire survey was employed to gather primary data. The surveys were distributed between January and February 2022. In particular, 1,875 questionnaires were received from students, who were the focus of this study (the results for teachers were presented in previous research). To process and interpret the data, the method of modeling with structural equations (SEM) was used. The data collected were processed using SPSS and AMOS. Findings: The results indicate that external factors do not influence perceived usefulness. Accordingly, students consider that the perceived ease of use does not influence the behavior intention to use new technologies. Conclusion: The results linked e-learning satisfaction to academic success and Romanian students who utilized e-learning during the pandemic. In addition, the results indicate that external factors do not influence perceived usefulness. Accordingly, students consider that the perceived ease of use does not influence the behavior intention to use new technologies. The results validated the basic variables of the TAM model. Implications: The study presents a series of theoretical, practical, and societal implications that can guide universities in adopting sustainable development goals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","corporate social responsibility; digitalization; sustainability; technology acceptance model; universities",""

However, public acceptance is critical to their success, given widespread skepticism (often due to limited knowledge about the potential environmental and health risks). This work examines the public mindset, identifying factors that may explain the transition from opposition to strong support. It also explores how traditional technical analysis may be successfully integrated with social perspectives to improve policy effectiveness. To this end, an online survey was administered to a sample of 240 Italian consumers. Three groups are identified from survey data: (i) opponents, (ii) weak supporters, and (iii) strong supporters. Results show that perceived risk factors are central in explaining the difference between groups, with lower perceived health and environmental concerns associated with general support for the technology, and trust in local government management associated with strong (as compared to weak) support. Health, environmental, and safety/control concerns negatively affected willingness to pay. The main implications suggest that different perceptions exist for WtE given that they are a sustainable technology compared to landfill use but without compromising separate collection and more virtuous waste management practices. This social sustainable approach can be supported by policies that promote energizing waste. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular economy; Community engagement; Policy implications; Social analysis; Waste-to-energy","Economics; Environmental technology; Health; Health risks; Surveys; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Waste management; Circular economy; Community engagement; Energy; Policy implications; Public acceptance; Social analyse; Sustainable urban development; Waste to energy; Waste-to-energy plants; Waste-to-energy technologies; Public policy; knowledge; landfill; local government; local participation; perception; risk factor; waste management"

They provide users with a sense of social presence, potentially stimulating social interaction in distance education. Insights on how VR enhances the social aspects of learning are scarce, however, and past examinations often focused on the effects of short usage times of self-developed VR learning applications. To analyze the potential of a simple-to-apply off-the-shelf social VR environment in distance education, in this qualitative study, a sample of 35 master's students employed the AltspaceVR platform for university seminars and group work over a six-week while campus access was restricted due to the covid-19 pandemic, and 23 of them were interviewed to examine their perception of the technology. The results show that social VR facilitated feelings of social presence, a more natural and spontaneous way of communicating with peers and teachers, and an increased sense of community in the classroom, compared to the alternative of videoconferencing. Participants reported high acceptance of the technology for teaching and learning tasks, particularly for interactive activities (e.g., workgroups) in small groups, but also identified limitations related to aspects such as image resolution, lack of note-taking tools, or the feeling of dizziness and fatigue after prolonged use. These results highlight the potential advantages of social VR for stimulating the social dimensions of online education, as well as the remaining challenges that need to be addressed to enable its use in higher education. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19 pandemic; Higher education; Online education; Social presence; Virtual reality",""

The unmet emotional needs of residents in LTC have driven researchers and decision-makers to consider novel technologies to improve care and quality of life for residents. Ageist stereotypes have contributed to the underuse of technologies by the older population. Telepresence robots have been found to be easy to use and do not require older adults to learn how to operate the robot but are remotely controlled by family members. The study aimed to understand the perspectives of multidisciplinary university students, including healthcare students, on using telepresence robots in LTC homes. The study would contribute to the future planning, implementation, and design of robotics in LTC. Methods: Between December 2021 and March 2022, our team conducted interviews with 15 multidisciplinary students. We employed a qualitative descriptive (QD) approach with semi-structured interview methods. Our study aimed to understand the perspectives of university students (under the age of 40) on using telepresence robots in LTC homes. Participants were invited to spend 15 min remotely driving a telepresence robot prior to the interview. A diverse team of young researchers and older adults (patient and family partners) conducted reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Six themes were identified: Robots as supplementary interaction; privacy, confidentiality, and physical harm; increased mental well-being and opportunities for interactions; intergenerational perspectives add values; staffing capacity; environmental and cultural factors influence acceptance. Conclusion: We identified a diverse range of perspectives regarding risk and privacy among participants regarding the implementation of telepresence robots in long-term care. Participants shared the importance of the voice of the resident and their own for creating more equitable decision-making and advocating for including this type of technology within LTC. Our study would contribute to the future planning, implementation, and design of robotics in LTC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ethical risk; gerontechnology; long-term care; older adult; person-centered care; social connection; students; telepresence robot",""

Surgeons exhibit cognitive complexity (abstractness vs. concreteness) when accepting any form of health technology. Surgeons choose technologies on behalf of their patients, taking patient priorities and expectations into account. Prior research has focused on cognitive complexity in the context of health technology adoption, but the issue of technology acceptance has not been addressed. The purpose of this study to use the construal level (CL) theory to determine the role of behavioural abstraction levels in the acceptance of surgical health technology. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of 556 min of seminar-based data and semi-directive interviews, the surgeons’ experiences regarding the acceptance of health technology were analysed. A non-directive observational method was used to permit the spontaneous emergence of CL dimensions in a natural environment. A categorization model was used for data coding, and MAXQDA, in addition to traditional multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, was used to generate results with joint displays. Findings: Effort expectancy, learning curve, performance risk, habit, patient clinical condition, clinical outcome expectancy, technology setting and social influence were construed at a low construal level (LCL). On the other hand, patient paying capacity, technology cost, price value, financial risk and patient performance expectation were construed at a high construal level (HCL). The study also reveals duality-based factors which showed proximity to HCL but intersected at LCL, and vice versa. Duality-based factors such as effort expectancy, surgical technique, trust and perceived risk intersected at HCL, whereas performance expectancy, relative advantage, time expectancy, perceived value, physical risk and peer group influence intersected at LCL. Originality/value: This is one of the early studies that presented the impact of behavioural abstraction on behavioural intention to accept health technology for surgeries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construal level theory; Health technology acceptance; UTAUT2",""

However, there have been limited attempts to confirm this by using measured and integrated studies to identify specific user motivations and behaviors that can be managed to achieve improved outcomes. Objective: This study aims to document and analyze survey and interview data from a diverse range of health care staff members, to determine the primary motivations and behaviors that influence their acceptance and application of cyber security messaging and controls. By identifying these issues, recommendations can be made to positively influence future cyber security governance in health care. Methods: An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was undertaken to analyze quantitative data from a web-based staff survey (N=103), with a concurrent qualitative investigation applied to data gathered via in-depth staff interviews (N=9). Data from both stages of this methodology were mapped to descriptive variables based on a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; TAM2). After normalization, the quantitative data were verified and analyzed using descriptive statistics, distribution and linearity measures, and a bivariate correlation of the TAM variables to identify the Pearson coefficient (r) and significance (P) values. Finally, after confirming Cronbach α, the determinant score for multicollinearity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure, and applying the Bartlett test of sphericity (χ2), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the primary factors with an eigenvalue (λ) >1.0. Comments captured during the qualitative interviews were coded using NVivo software (QSR International) to create an emic-to-etic understanding, which was subsequently integrated with the quantitative results to produce verified conclusions. Results: Using the explanatory sequential methodology, this study showed that the perceived usefulness of security controls emerged as the most significant factor influencing staff beliefs and behaviors. This variable represented 24% of all the variances measured in the EFA and was also the most common category identified across all coded interviews (281/692, 40.6%). The word frequency analysis showed that systems, patients, and people represented the top 3 recurring themes reported by the interviewees. Conclusions: To improve cyber security governance in large health care environments, efforts should be focused on demonstrating how confidentiality, integrity, availability, policies, and cloud or vendor-based controls (the main contributors of usefulness measured by the EFA) can directly improve outcomes for systems, staff, and patients. Further consideration also needs to be given to how clinicians should share data and collaborate on patient care, with tools and processes provided to support and manage data sharing securely and to achieve a consistent baseline of secure and normalized behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Australia; computer security; cyber security; delivery of health care; governance; mixed methods; surveys",""

The results show that: (1) Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on farmers’ land transfer behavior. The effect of perceived usefulness is stronger than that of perceived ease of use, and the effect of economic perceived usefulness is the strongest. (2) Family environment, social environment and land environment indirectly affect farmers’ land transfer behavior by affecting their perception of land transfer. (3) The decision-making path of farmers’ land transfer behavior is: external environmental factors → perceived usefulness → land transfer behavior; external environmental factors → perceived ease of use → land transfer behavior; external environment → perceived ease of use → perceived usefulness → land transfer behavior. It can be seen that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use based on specific environment will have a significant impact on land transfer behavior. Therefore, to promote land transfer, we should focus on increasing the economic benefits of land transfer and improving the convenience of transfer transactions based on local reality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","influencing factors; land transfer; partial least squares structuraequation model; technology acceptance model; underdeveloped areas",""

The metaverse refers to a virtual realm that integrates physical reality with digital environments, enabling users to interact, socialize, and participate in a wide range of activities through the use of avatars and immersive technologies. While there are advantages to adopt the metaverse, the metaverse adoption researches are scarce and primarily focus on the game, education, and sport, providing limited attention to banking services. Furthermore, most adoption research using standard information technology/information system models has focused primarily on organizational context and adopted compulsorily. Metaverse banking service is mainly adopted voluntarily by users and for personal purposes. Thus, this leads to the difficulty in drawing meaningful conclusions toward metaverse adoption. The study addresses these issues by proposing a new unified theory of acceptance and use of the metaverse technology model (UTAUMT), which consists of metaverse performance expectancy (MPE), metaverse facilitating conditions (MFC), metaverse effort expectancy (MEE), and metaverse social influence (MSI) to determine metaverse banking service adoption. Moreover, metaverse trust (MET) and metaverse financial resources (MEF) are also incorporated to investigate complexity in the metaverse environment. The integrated model has been developed and validated through a pretest (face validity and content validity) and pilot test before applying to 491 metaverses-experienced users in Vietnam through a questionnaire approach. Partial least squares structural equation modelling-artificial neural network (PLS-SEM-ANN) has provided a comprehensive result as it can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships. The results from the model showed that only one of the proposed hypotheses between metaverse financial resources (MEF) and behavioural intention to use metaverse banking services (BIM) was not supported in this study and thus needed further investigation. The study contributes to the academic literature by proposing new constructs to assess users' likelihood of adopting metaverse banking services. The result also assists bank managers in understanding metaverse banking adoption and makes them realize the metaverse banking services' growth opportunity to pursue. Given the limited scope of the study focusing solely on Vietnam, it would be advantageous for future research on the cultural variations among users of mobile social commerce to incorporate a comparative analysis across multiple countries, with a particular emphasis on Asian nations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",""

Drawing on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the initial trust model (ITM), a conceptual framework was developed that linked attitudinal and psychological factors to behavioral intention for DRT usage. 1168 valid observations were collected from adults aged 19–64 years in the Republic of Korea using a structured online survey, and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that the four UTAUT constructs (performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and environmental concerns) were directly related to intention for DRT usage. Indirect impacts of perceived safety, structural assurance, familiarity, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy on initial trust were also found. Consequently, the constructs with the greatest total effect on usage intention were (in order of relevance) initial trust, performance expectancy, social influence, and structural assurance. As one of the few attempts to examine public acceptance of DRT, it is expected that findings from this study could contribute to the literature by providing insights into potential users’ attitudes toward DRT. This study further offers guidance on designing interventions intended to promote a transition toward increased operational efficiency through policy developments for DRT, thereby achieving sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand-responsive transportation; Initial trust model (ITM); Shared mobility; Technology acceptance model; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)",""

METHODOLOGY: Within a qualitative and exploratory multiple case theory-building approach, data was collected from twelve technology entrepreneurs from Brazil, Mexico, Germany, and Israel that went to the following destination countries: Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Ireland, Turkey, and the Netherlands. With interview data as the primary source, the data analysis rests on a qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: Data allows structuring techpreneurs’ experience of expatriation along the following steps: (a) arrival in the destination country and initial process of socialization, (b) engaging in activities to get familiar with the culture of the destination country, (c) the gradual comprehensive understanding of the new context, and (d) comparisons between the home and destination country. Expatriation had an evident impact on the technology-based entrepreneurs that materializes in three groups of competencies: entrepreneurial competencies, knowledge and innovative competencies, and international competencies. Entrepreneurial competencies relate to relational and behavioral skills and the learning of doing business in different contexts. Concerning knowledge and innovative competencies, creativity, learning new techniques and international innovation environment stand at the fore. Finally, international competencies relate to the acceptance of different cultures (multicultural learning and perception of cultural differences), developing a sense of an international community and an international innovation culture. IMPLICATIONS: This study evidenced the influence of expatriation experiences on the training of skills of technology-based entrepreneurs, in a specific approach to entrepreneurial, innovative, and intercultural competencies. The research portrays self-expatriation as an opportunity for technology-based entrepreneurs to develop different competencies being helpful to innovate, to manage business and to operate in international markets. Universities and innovators may recognize their discretion to develop programs for people like former students who want to self-expatriate. In the same vein, government can design policy to attract selfexpatriate in innovations hubs, considering that local inhabitants can benefit from the cultural exchange. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: This study contributes to better understanding the influence of self-expatriation experiences on the development of skills of technology-based entrepreneurs. Compared to previous studies, it advances research through providing a wider range of learning from expatriation experiences beyond the effect of internationalization on market knowledge and cultural aspects. Furthermore, this study focuses the process, not the results of self-expatriation to understand entrepreneurs’ learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","competencies; entrepreneurs; expatriation; innovation; skills; technology-based entrepreneurs",""

Therefore, it is essential to identify and address trust in cloud service providers as one of the key predictors of the acceptance of cloud computing. Several prior studies covered the technological facets of cloud-based contexts, including cloud virtualization, scalability, and security. However, it is argued that the biggest barrier to cloud computing is not technical but rather cognitive or behavioral and in particular attitudinal. Thus, this research aims to study individuals' attitudes and perceptions toward cloud computing, with a particular concentration on the perception of trust and its constructs in the cloud computing environment, namely Service Level Agreements (SLA) verification and reputation, in order to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing in Saudi Arabia. This study presents an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to include trust as a cognition, representing a person's perception of social influence to perform or not perform a behavior under consideration. The study model also identifies factors affecting cloud computing adoption by considering reputation-based trust and SLA verification-based trust variables, which have been rarely examined before. The proposed model was able to explain 64% of the variance in behavioral intention and 78% of individuals' attitudes toward the adoption of cloud computing in Saudi Arabia. The study's findings show that the proposed model explained a significant amount of variation in cloud computing adoption. It suggests that the model expansion by incorporating trust in cloud computing service providers, reputation-based trust, and SLA verification-based trust factors were valuable explorations. Further, the results also show that ""reputation-based trust"" alone explains 29.46% of individuals’ attitudes and 23.45% of their ""behavioral intentions"" toward using cloud computing. This effect on people's attitudes and intentions towards adopting cloud computing was indirect and through the trust construct. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud Computing; Government Cloud; Reputation-Based Trust; SLA Verification-Based Trust; Technology Acceptance; Trust",""

The cooperatives have faced challenges in adapting to the changing business environment, which has resulted in a negative image, particularly among the younger generation, as being outdated, conventional, small-scale, and located in underprivileged areas. The emergence of technology-based alternative marketing mediums, such as Social Media Marketing, has provided new opportunities for cooperatives in recent years. While some cooperatives have embraced this technology as a means of marketing, others have chosen not to due to various reasons. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the factors that influence cooperatives in utilizing technology-based Social Media Marketing as an alternative. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Davis was adopted in this study with random purposive sampling. The results of hypothesis testing show that the Ability to Use Social Media (ASM) positively affects Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) on Social Media. ASM has no positive effect on the Perceived Usefulness (PU) of Social Media. Furthermore, PEU positively influences the PU of Social Media Marketing as well as Attitude Toward Using (ATU) on Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU); Actual System Use (ASU) of Social Media is not affected by marketing BIU, and; PEU positively affects ATU Social Media.

However, it was largely unknown how likely would medical students continue to adopt this form of hastily implemented remote learning solution after the pandemic ends. Using a two-stage partial least squares structural equation modelling approach, a study was conducted to develop a set of questionnaires to measure this intention and determine the influence of perceived benefits (5 items) and perceived ease of use (7 items) on the behavioural intention to continue adopting online PBL. The technology acceptance model was adopted as the conceptual framework of this study. Environment factors (11 items derived from PEST analysis, where P = policy, E = economic, S = social, and T = technology factors) were incorporated as the third independent construct in our model. A total of 149 Year 2 medical students participated in this study. Overall, the mean score for behavioural intention to continue adopting online PBL was 3.42 out of 5 (where 1 = most unlikely and 5 = most likely). Only the construct perceived ease of use had significant influence on the behavioural intention to continue adopting online PBL (path coefficient standardised β = 0.312; t-statistics = 2.960; p = 0.003). Perceived benefits and environment factors were not shown to have significant influence. In conclusion, as no strong intention to continue adopting online PBL was demonstrated in this study, conventional face-to-face PBL should be resumed until clear benefits of a carefully designed online PBL can be demonstrated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVIDs-19; Online platform; PEST analysis; Problem-based learning; Technology acceptance model",""

Healthcare has become more accessible, affordable, and efficient to sensors, wearables, and health monitors. The healthcare industry's adoption of the Internet of Things is lagging behind other sectors despite its many benefits. This study aims to investigate the extent to which chronic patients in Malaysia are using healthcare services made possible by the Internet of Things. To that end, this study proposes a unified framework to examine how these highlighted factors affect Behavioral Intention (BI) with regard to adopting IoT healthcare services. The innovation here is in bringing together three distinct theories: i) the Technology-Organization-Environment Framework (TOE), which is a framework for understanding how companies adopt new technologies; ii) the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT); and iii) the Social Exchange Theory (SE). Patients in Malaysia who are coping with long-term health issues were surveyed online. This study also employs SPSS and Smart Partial Least Square (Smart PLS) for data analysis. Eleven hypothesized predictive components have been investigated. The results showed that chronic illness patients' BI towards adopting IoT solutions was considerably impacted by both individual and technological factors and related aspects. The impact of BI on Use Behaviour (UB) also showed similar outcomes. Moreover, trust somewhat mediates the impact of both individual and technological factors on BI. The findings of this investigation will be beneficial to policymakers and suppliers of healthcare in that country. Additionally, the patients and their family members would gain benefits from the study due to the fact that the delivery of comprehensive treatment, especially in the field of chronic disease management, will be improved through IoT-healthcare services. The Internet of Things will also let medical staff function remotely and professionally. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption; adoption theories; chronic disease; Internet of things; IoT","Diseases; Patient treatment; Adoption; Adoption theory; Behavioral intention; Chronic disease; Chronic illness; Healthcare industry; Healthcare services; Individual factors; Malaysia; Technological factors; Internet of things"

Objective: The study aims to identify the predictors of older people’s intention to use mHealth in South Korea and verify whether chronic disease moderates the effect of the identified predictors on behavioral intentions. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among 500 participants aged 60 to 75 years. The research hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling, and indirect effects were verified through bootstrapping. Bootstrapping was performed 10,000 times, and the significance of the indirect effects was confirmed through the bias-corrected percentile method. Results: Of 477 participants, 278 (58.3%) had at least 1 chronic disease. Performance expectancy (β=.453; P=.003) and social influence (β=.693; P<.001) were significant predictors of behavioral intention. Bootstrapping results showed that facilitating conditions (β=.325; P=.006; 95% CI 0.115-0.759) were found to have a significant indirect effect on behavioral intention. Multigroup structural equation modeling testing the presence or absence of chronic disease revealed a significant difference in the path of device trust to performance expectancy (critical ratio=–2.165). Bootstrapping also confirmed that device trust (β=.122; P=.039; 95% CI 0.007-0.346) had a significant indirect effect on behavioral intention in people with chronic disease. Conclusions: This study, which explored the predictors of the intention to use mHealth through a web-based survey of older people, suggests similar results to those of other studies that applied the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to the acceptance of mHealth. Performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions were revealed as predictors of accepting mHealth. In addition, trust in a wearable device for measuring biosignals was investigated as an additional predictor in people with chronic disease. This suggests that different strategies are needed, depending on the characteristics of users. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceptance; adoption; chronic disease; environmental risk factor; gerontology; health app; health care service; intention to use; mHealth; mobile app; mobile health; older adult; personalized; personalized health care service app; structural equation modeling; technology use; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology",""

Background The potential growth of capital market investors in Indonesia is large, and the low use of the Internet for investment purposes makes it necessary for stakeholders to understand the factors that affect people's intentions to invest, especially through online platforms. Several previous studies have explained the intention to use online investment platforms using the TAM and TPB theories. This study tries to combine TAM, TPB, and UTAUT theories in analyzing behavioral intentions to use an online capital market investment platform in Indonesia. Methodology The research approach employed is a mixed method, particularly explanatory research, which employs quantitative methods first, followed by qualitative methods. Data were collected by conducting interviews and sending online surveys. This study was successful in collecting information on the users of online capital market investment platforms in Indonesia from 1074 respondents, which was then processed and analyzed using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) with the IBM AMOS 26.0 application. Contribution This study complements earlier theories like TAM, TPB, and UTAUT by looking at the intention to use online capital market investment platforms from technological, human, and environmental viewpoints. This study looks at the intention to use the online capital market investing platform as a whole rather than separately depending on investment instruments. This study also assists practitioners including regulators, the government, developers, and investors by offering knowledge of the phenomena and factors that can increase the capital market's investment intention in Indonesia. Findings Attitudes, perceived ease of use, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and national pride were found to be significant predictors of the intention to use online investment platforms in Indonesia, whereas perceived usefulness, perceived risk, perceived trust, perceived privacy, and price value were not. Recommendations All practitioners must be able to take steps and strategies that focus on factors for Practitioners that have a significant impact on increasing usage intentions. The government can enact legislation that emphasizes the simplicity and convenience of investment, as well as launch campaigns that encourage people to participate in economic recovery by investing in the capital market. Meanwhile, the developers are concentrating on facilitating the flow of investment transactions through the platform, increasing education and awareness of the benefits of investing in the capital market, and providing content that raises awareness that investing in the capital market can help to restore the national economy. Recommendations Further research is intended to include other variables such as perceived benefor Researchers fits and perceived security, as well as other frameworks such as TRA, to better explain individuals' behavioral intentions to use online capital investment platforms. Impact on Society This study can help all stakeholders understand what factors can increase Indonesians' interest in investing in the capital market, particularly through online investment platforms. This understanding is expected to increase the number of capital market participants and, as a result, have an impact on economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. Future Research Future research is expected to investigate additional factors that can influence individuals' behavioral intention to use an online capital market investment platform, such as perceived benefits and perceived security, as well as the addition of control variables such as age, gender, education, and income. International research across nations is also required to build a larger sample size in order to examine the behavior of investors in developing and developed countries and acquire a more thorough understanding of the online capital market investment platform. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","actual usage; behavioral intention to use; capital market; financial technology; online investment platform","Behavioral research; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Actual usage; Behavioral intention; Behavioral intention to use; Financial technology; Indonesia; Intention to use; Online investment platform; Online investments; Technology acceptance model; Theory of Planned Behavior; Investments"

Examples of Innovative retail advances include online shopping and self-scanning technologies. Although SSTs are becoming more popular in Western societies, the same is not true for developing ones. Modern retail advances like self-service applications were welcomed by some communities, while others were unwilling to adapt and adopt these inventions. In economies like Palestine, these cultural elements may play a significant role in the framework of social contexts and perceptions of merchant and consumer relationships. The main objective of this study was to determine how culture and characteristics of internal and external incentive factors influence Palestinian customers’ attitudes towards self-service technologies. As an introduction to motivational factors, the cultural-self theory was explored to comprehend the relationships between customers’ attitudes towards using self-service technologies. The model suggests that intrinsic and extrinsic incentive factors, including perceived pleasure, technological anxiety and perceived timesaving, influence customers’ attitudes towards using self-service technologies. According to this research, educated and employed Palestinian customers were more interested in having fun using self-service technologies than they were in saving time or being more useful. Thus, it is proposed that efficient marketing connection strategies concentrate on the enjoyable and pleasureable sides of using self-service technology. Palestinian customers in this research were eager to learn new self-service technologies, even though they had no previous experience; they were ready to cope with any fear they may have about adopting new technology. Hence, store managers should stress the training of their employees. To help customers switch from employee-assisted services to self-service. Appropriate self-service techniques must be incorporated by managers to maintain offering a decent, quicker and more reliable service. This may boost both profits and shop loyalty. The literature is divided on whether SST research should focus on the moderator. Some research use TAM, which posits that usefulness and ease of use fully moderate the effects of various SST acceptance variables, whilst others postulate direct impacts on SST use. We look at the moderator to see how different antecedent conditions affect SST acceptance. Investigating the moderator function of cultural factors of use broadens our grasp of both the determinants of SST acceptance and the mechanisms through which these predictors exert influence. This research contributes to increasing the base of learning about consumers’ shopping trends regarding self-service technology and addresses a gap in the literature on the potential of employing self-service technology in the Palestinian retail environment. Retailers wishing to improve their service offerings can use the results to provide customers with an additional way to buy products in-store. There is a need for future research that applies the model to a wide range of people, many types of self-service technologies, and merchants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cultural-self perspective; intrinsic & extrinsic motivation factors; SST; TAM",""

The model is adaptable to any country and does not require social engagement methods, thus producing more objective results. Indicators are assessed case-by-case and receive a score from zero to five. Lower scores show a greater need for prioritizing the indicator when adopting a specific alternative fuel vehicle. A low score doesn't mean a low impact, but instead emphasizes the importance of improving the relevant indicator for the particular vehicle technology in the studied region. The case study conducted in Morocco tested the model, highlighting the superior performance of hybrid-electric vehicles based on their score. Although these vehicles offer financial profitability, their successful adoption relies on the government's provision of more options, reduced purchase costs, and improved secondary road infrastructure. Battery-electric vehicles, while facing challenges in terms of maintenance and charging infrastructure, can be addressed in Morocco by implementing on-site generation in charging stations and enhancing secondary road infrastructure. On the other hand, fuel-cell vehicles have notable social requirements and necessitate more extensive efforts to penetrate the market compared to battery-electric vehicles. Finally, the authors suggest including more alternative fuel vehicles in the model and additional social variables, such as user experience, vehicle size, fuel efficiency, environmental awareness, purchasing behavior, and brand loyalty. The suggestion would allow gaining more insight into social preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","barriers and challenges; Electric vehicles; fuel-cell vehicles; hybrid electric vehicles; mathematical modeling; Morocco; social acceptance; social factors; sustainable mobility; technology acceptance model","Alternative fuels; Cell engineering; Charging (batteries); Environmental impact; Hybrid vehicles; Roads and streets; Sales; Secondary batteries; Barrier and challenge; Fuel cell vehicles; Government; Mathematical modeling; Morocco; Social acceptance; Social factor; Sustainable mobility; Technology acceptance model; Fuel cells"

The results provide evidence for VR to have a positive effect on travel intention through both higher perceived enjoyment and higher environmental involvement. However, these effects were observed to be not as significant when considering travel intention during the pandemic. While stronger telepresence achieved by VR may encourage users to engage in more sustainable behaviour and improve enjoyment from the experience, the avoidance to travel stemming from health and safety concerns amidst the pandemic greatly offset the effectiveness of VR as a marketing tool.

However, older adults vary in how they use these technologies, and there is a lack of knowledge regarding the motivations that influence their acceptance and use of health-related technologies in home environments. Objective: This study aimed to understand the types of technologies that older adults use to support their health and the factors that motivate them to use their chosen technologies to support their health. In addition, we aimed to understand the factors that enable the effective use of technologies for health self-management and to identify the barriers that can negatively affect the adoption of technologies. Methods: A total of 22 older adults participated in semistructured interviews regarding their experiences of using technologies for health self-management. Interview transcripts were analyzed through an in-depth thematic analysis. Results: The interviews revealed that a range of technologies, such as videoconferencing software, fitness trackers, and other devices, were being used by older adults to support their health. Interviews showed that participants were motivated to use technologies to monitor health issues, to stay active and connected, and to record and change their behavior in the light of foreseen risks related to their future health status. Enablers that facilitated the effective use of technologies include social and organizational influence, convenient access to health care and safety provided by the technology, and easy setup and low cost of the technology. Barriers include information overload and a sense of futility about future health decline; telehealth being an inadequate substitute for in-person consultation; concerns about trust related to privacy and accuracy; and technologies being stigmatizing, uncomfortable to use, expensive, and unfamiliar. Conclusions: This study suggested that older adults were using a variety of technologies to prevent or prepare for future health decline, evidencing a resilient attitude toward health and aging. In addition, older adults were willing to continue using the technology when there was a perceived need. The enabler mentioned by most participants was the social and organizational influence that included health care staff, family, friends, and organizations. This analysis provides a better understanding of how older adults use technologies to support their health and can guide the provision of appropriate health technologies for them. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","barrier; enabler; health self-management; motivator; older adults; technology",""

Especially if the information is collected through audio–video devices, the question is even more delicate due to the nature of these data. In addition to guaranteeing a high level of privacy, it is necessary to reassure end users about the correct use of these streams. The evolution of data analysis techniques began to take on an important role and increasingly defined characteristics in recent years. The purpose of this paper is twofold: on the one hand, it presents a state of the art about privacy in European Active Healthy Ageing/Active Healthy Ageing projects, with a focus on those related to audio and video processing. On the other hand, it proposes a methodology, developed in the context of the European project PlatfromUptake.eu, to identify clusters of stakeholders and application dimensions (technical, contextual, and business), define their characteristics, and show how privacy constraints affect them. From this study, we then generated a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis in which we aim to identify the critical features connected to the selection and involvement of relevant stakeholders for the success of a project. Applying this type of methodology to the initial stages of a project allows understanding of which privacy issues could be related to the various stakeholder groups and which problems can then affect the correct development of the project. The idea is, therefore, to suggest a privacy-by-design approach according to the categories of stakeholders and project dimensions. The analysis will cover technical aspects, legislative and policies-related aspects also regarding the point of view of the municipalities, and aspects related to the acceptance and, therefore, to the perception of the safety of these technologies by the final end users. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AAL; AHA; IS; ISA; privacy by design","Article; assisted living facility; audio recording; business ethics; data analysis; data privacy; design; law; patient care; policy; privacy; risk assessment; social environment; stakeholder engagement; Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats; videorecording; wellbeing"

Artisanal fishers are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental change on the fisheries on which their livelihoods depend. Although we found that most fishers accept that CC is occurring locally, most believe that other environmental problems affecting fisheries are more important than CC. Opinions on the causes of CC vary widely according to the age and education level of fishermen. Most fishermen, mainly the older and less educated ones, attribute CC to divine will or magic-religious causes, while only one fifth link it to human activities. Older fishers were also more likely to apply traditional knowledge and religion to adapt to CC. In contrast, younger fishers were the most reluctant to attribute a reason to CC, but were the most willing to adopt modern technologies or adapt fishing methods to changing conditions. We found that most fishermen used a variety of approaches, including traditional practices, magic-religious practices and modern technologies, to adapt to CC; only a few fishers have adopted a single approach. Policies developed to help fishers adapt to CC should incorporate their sociological and cultural norms to promote policy acceptance, rather than treating non-scientific approaches as completely irrational or assuming that practitioners are fatalistic about the impacts of CC. Useful actions that are acceptable to fishermen in their adaptation to CC should involve a thorough understanding of social and environmental considerations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Artisanal fishermen; Climate change; Perceptions; Representations; Small-scale fisheries",""

As before, specifically in March 2020, the WHO expressed that COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic. This transformation was accompanied by the widespread adoption of mobiles and their applications in learning with organised or non-organised forms. Although many articles have recorded the importance and effectiveness of mobile learning in higher education, other articles have indicated the weak utilisation of mobile learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic, especially by university educators (UEs). In addition, these articles often focus on the opportunities, challenges, and weaknesses of mobile learning amid COVID-19, but few studies have handled the acceptance of the UEs to adopt a mobile learning approach amid COVID-19 by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). This article’s main contribution is extending the (UTAUT) model in context and reviewing the acceptance of the adoption of mobiles and their applications in education as an approach amid global health emergencies, i.e., COVID-19 and monkeypox. The data were gathered from university educators (N = 392) in Saudi Arabia. The hypotheses were evaluated with data that were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results demonstrated that six of the eight hypotheses had high and significant effects on behaviour intention (performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EF), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), self-efficacy (SE), and users’ awareness (UA)). Two of the eight factors have insignificant or negative impacts on behaviour intention (users’ perceptions (UP) and technology challenges (TC)), which need an additional review by policymakers, practitioners, mobile learning providers, and investigators looking to develop efficient strategies concerning mobile learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19; digital learning; global health emergencies; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; mobile learning; monkeypox; sustainability of teaching; the (UTAUT)",""

The present study evaluated users’ attitudes towards using AR for learning complex tasks. The users are asked to interact with an AR Piling (ARP) application that shows various steps of a construction process. A set of selected practitioners and students used the application, and the evaluation involved various participants of different genders and backgrounds. A questionnaire was designed and data was collected through an online survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The model is modified considering education practices and adjusted to an AR app for learning purposes. The novelty of the model lies in various constructs such as technical quality, social influence, perceived immersion, learning, and perceived enjoyment. 200 responses were obtained and used for evaluating the proposed model. The attitude toward using AR and the perceived usefulness of AR were the two factors that determined the participants’ behavioral intention to use ARP. Respondents showed a high level of acceptance for AR. In education and higher learning contexts, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of how AR is accepted in complex learning environments.

The model was refined through a qualitative analysis based on six focus group discussions with students from different engineering faculties in Madrid, Spain. A survey involving 346 undergraduate students was subsequently fed into the model. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and SMART PLS software were applied for data analysis. The results shed light on theoretical and practical implications. The model was validated by the data and displayed a high predictive ability. Social influence was found to have the greatest influence over students’ acceptance, followed by the professor’s role in shaping the perception of improvement. Facilitating conditions were found to be the least relevant factor, probably due to the particular context in which this study was conducted. A significant difference was found between the public and private institutions in terms of the importance of the perceived usefulness for the professor (this factor was more important for students’ acceptance at the public university). In order to improve its acceptance and use under the current scenario, it is thus important for universities wishing to introduce e-learning to focus on creating a positive social environment around the e-learning platform, for example, by using social networks or relying on testimonies by professionals who could confirm the interest of such a platform in a future work environment. Understanding professors’ perspective on the implementation of the platform is also of paramount importance. More research is also needed regarding context-related differences when analysing students’ acceptance of e-learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID; e-learning; higher education; SEM; technology acceptance and use",""

Widespread COVID-19 adversely affected farmers’ employment, production practices, and livelihood resilience. At the same time, climate change is a key issue limiting agricultural production worldwide. Emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are a major factor leading to global climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production are receiving increasing attention. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop low-carbon agriculture. Based on data from 920 family farms in Jiangsu province and Shaanxi province, this study constructs a structural equation model and empirically tests the relationship between the variables using the bootstrap method. The results show that: (1) climate change awareness did not directly stimulate farmers’ willingness to pursue low-carbon production; (2) climate change awareness has an impact on low-carbon production willingness through perceived ease of use and consequence awareness; and (3) anti-risk ability can effectively moderate the impact of climate change awareness on low-carbon production behavior in agriculture. The theoretical model framework proposed in this study provides a reference for research in the field of low-carbon agriculture and also provides some insights and suggestions for environmentalists and governments. In addition, policymakers should effectively raise the sense of responsibility of farmers to address climate change and promote low-carbon agricultural production to achieve healthy and sustainable agricultural development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate change awareness; family farms; farmers’ willingness; low-carbon agriculture","agricultural production; carbon; climate change; family farm; modeling; smallholder; technology adoption; adult; agricultural management; agricultural worker; agriculture; Article; awareness; behavior; bootstrapping; carbon emission; China; conceptual framework; controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental management; human; low carbon production; mediation analysis; middle aged; psychological theory; questionnaire; reliability; statistical analysis; stimulus organism response; structural equation modeling; Technology Acceptance Model theory; validity; pandemic; procedures; Jiangsu; Shaanxi; Agriculture; Climate Change; COVID-19; Farmers; Humans; Pandemics"

However, chemical leasing is still a nascent business strategy in Taiwan. Using the unique case of Taiwan, this paper presents the first empirical data from pilot research studying the elements influencing a firm's underlying cognition and readiness to apply the innovative business model. We estimate a two-step hybrid method of the partial least squares structural equation and logit regression based on technology acceptance theories to explore the concerns and chances of Taiwanese manufacturing from a consumer's perspective at a policy level. Our findings revealed that most potential users still sit on the fence regarding whether to adopt, particularly in the neutral sphere of perceived ease of use. The likelihood of adoption increases by 8.8 % for every ten green knowledge level development points. Environmental awareness, perceived ease of use and usefulness, and risk preference toward sustainability and green production are essential decision-making improvement variables for encouraging chemical consumers. Concerns around the loss of technological know-how, noncompliance with government inspections and laws, and labor substitution may hinder their implementation, especially for large-sized enterprises. Chances would decrease by 13.4 % and 6.9 % for additional levels of concern, highlighting the need for trust and coordination among stakeholders in developing additional promotion guidelines for the authorities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical leasing; Circular economy strategy; Cleaner production; Sustainable environment; Technology acceptance model","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Manufacture; Planning; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Business models; Chemical leasing; Chemical strategy; Circular economy; Circular economy strategy; Cleaner production; Consumer perception; Perceived ease-of-use; Sustainable environment; Technology acceptance model; Least squares approximations"

Collected data from 378 respondents were analysed by a hybrid approach employing partial least squares (PLS) complemented by the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) technique. According to the findings, five major determinants emerged: trust, hedonic motivation, social influence, compatibility, and effort expectancy. Furthermore, compatibility positively moderates the association between performance expectancy and intention to use AVs. The findings shed light on determinant factors, their level of importance, and the potential interplay between them in shaping individuals’ intention to adopt and use AVs. Furthermore, the current research provides valuable insights to carmakers, technology developers, and practitioners on determinants of AVs adoption, assisting them in devising effective AVs-related strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous vehicles; Driverless cars; Intention to adopt; Technology acceptance; UTAUT2","artificial intelligence; environmental protection; equity; fuzzy mathematics; least squares method; technology adoption; transportation safety; unmanned vehicle"

Recently, a rapid development of solar energy has been observed in Poland and is estimated that the country now has about 700,000 photovoltaics prosumers. In October 2021, the total photovoltaics power in Poland amounted to nearly 5.7 GW. The calculated technical potential of photovoltaics in Poland is 153.484 PJ (42.634 TWh). This would cover 26.04% of Poland’s electricity needs. The main aim of the article is to assess the level of development of the photovoltaic market in Poland, the genesis of its creation, description of the current situation and determination of the development opportunities. As part of the aim, programs supporting the development of solar energy in Poland have been described and the SWOT analysis has also been performed. The strengths of photovoltaics include high social acceptance and low costs of photovoltaics system operation, while opportunities include rapidly increasing technological efficiency and decreasing cost of solar systems. On the other hand, weaknesses include the high costs of photovoltaics systems and the disparities in the amount of solar energy reaching the market during the year, whereas climate change and the coronavirus pandemic are threats. In 2020, PV became an investment hit in the energy sector and an economic driver in Poland. In the difficult time of two lockdowns caused by the global pandemic, domestic PV made a significant contribution to the maintenance of investment processes in the amount of PLN 9.5 billion and provided Poland with 35 thousand jobs. In 2020, 1.5% of the country’s electricity came from PV sources. In 2021, it will be 3.5%, and by 2025, solar energy will provide approx. 10% of Poland’s electricity. It is worth examining the development of photovoltaics from a broad and long-term perspective. The spectacular development of photovoltaics in Poland is due to hitting the right time window and reducing technology costs, but most of all, it is based on the cooperation of stakeholders and trust in the regulatory environment.

Not only was the use of e-learning technologies heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the shift to predominantly online teaching and learning was abrupt. It has become clear that acceptance of e-learning technology will be crucial for higher education in a post-COVID-19 world. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the acceptance of e-learning applications by accounting students at residential universities in South Africa. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was adapted for this study to examine the relevance of its constructs in understanding students’ intent to use e-learning applications. Accounting students registered at four South African universities completed an electronic questionnaire (n = 1 864). Structural Equation Modelling using the Partial Least Squares method was used to test the hypothesised relationships. The findings indicate that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and habit have a significant relationship with behavioural intention to use e-learning applications. However, gender, academic performance, and level of study do not have a significant moderating effect on these relationships. The study reported in this paper contributes to technology acceptance research by testing the UTAUT2 model in a cross-institutional context with a larger sample size than used in similar studies. Furthermore, it has practical value for higher education policymakers, institutions, and lecturers in their attempts to adapt to blended and online learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","accounting education; e-learning; higher education; South Africa; technology acceptance; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2)",""

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is probably the most notable, with others such as database management systems (DBMS), decision support systems (DSS), planning support systems (PSS), and expert systems (ES), having mixed levels of recognition and acceptance (Kontokosta, C. E. (2021). Urban informatics in the science and practice of planning. Journal of Planning Education and Research, 41(4), 382–395. doi:10.1177/0739456X18793716; Yigitcanlar, T., Desouza, K. C., Butler, L., & Roozkhosh, F. (2020). Contributions and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) in building smarter cities: Insights from a systematic review of the literature. Energies, 13(6), 1473). Advances in information technologies have moved very slowly in the field of urban planning, more recently concerning ‘smart city’ technologies while revolutionizing other domains, such as consumer goods and services. Baidu, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and many others are using these technologies to gain insights into consumer behaviour and characteristics and improve supply chains and logistics. This is an opportune time for urban planners to consider the application of AI-related techniques given vast increases in data availability, increased processing speeds, and increased popularity and development of planning related applications. Research on these topics by urban planning scholars has increased over the past few years, but there is little evidence to suggest that the results are making it into the hands of professional planners (Batty, M. (2018). Artificial intelligence and smart cities. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 45(1), 3–6; Batty, M. (2021). Planning education in the digital age. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 48(2), 207–211). Others encourage planners to leverage the ubiquity of data and advances in computing to enhance redistributive justice in information resources and procedural justice in decision-making among marginalized communities (Boeing, G., Besbris, M., Schachter, A., & Kuk, J. (2020). Housing search in the Age of Big data: Smarter cities or the same Old blind spots? Housing Policy Debate, 31(1), 112–126; Goodspeed, R. (2015). Smart cities: Moving beyond urban cybernetics to tackle wicked problems. Cambridge journal of regions, Economy and Society, 8(1), 79–92). This article highlights findings from a recent literature review on AI in planning and discusses the results of a national survey of urban planners about their perspectives on AI adoption and concerns they have expressed about its broader use in the profession. Currently, the outlook is mixed, matching how urban planners initially viewed the early stages of computer adoption within the profession. And yet today, personal computers are essential to any job. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; data science; technology; Urban planning",""

Robot behavior in a social setting is the key to human acceptance while ensuring human comfort and safety. With the advancement in robotics technology, the true use cases of robots in the tourism and hospitality industry are expanding in number. There are very few experimental studies focusing on how people perceive the navigation behavior of a delivery robot. A robotic platform named “PI” has been designed, which incorporates proximity and vision sensors. The robot utilizes a real-time object recognition algorithm based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to detect objects and humans during navigation. This study is aimed towards evaluating human experience, for which we conducted a study among 36 participants to explore the perceived social presence, role, and perception of a delivery robot exhibiting different behavior conditions while navigating in a hotel corridor. The participants’ responses were collected and compared for different behavior conditions demonstrated by the robot and results show that humans prefer an assistant role of a robot enabled with audio and visual aids exhibiting social behavior.

Currently in Japan, such houses are not as popular as anticipated and sales do not meet the national government target. Accordingly, household buying process should be investigated to develop policies to encourage the spreading of ZEHs. Therefore, we investigated which factors influenced purchasers’ intentions and behaviors. We based our purchase process modeling on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, which includes six constructs, i.e., use behavior, behavioral intention, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Our model also considered the effects of the information content buyers obtained and the channels they used on performance expectancy. In our estimation, we used Bayesian structural equation modeling and response from 297 Japanese households. It was found that certain information content and channel combinations, e.g., health aspect information obtained from salespersons effectively enhanced performance expectancy. Although performance expectancy did not significantly facilitate the use intention, social influence and facilitating conditions effectively promoted intention leading to purchase. Our findings contribute to more appropriate information provision strategies and supporting policies to promote the spread of these houses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian structural equation modeling (Bayesian SEM); received information; technology adoption; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT); Zero-energy house (ZEH)","Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Houses; Purchasing; Sales; Bayesian; Bayesian structural equation modeling; Performance; Received information; Structural equation models; Technology adoption; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Zero energy house; Zero-energy house; Health risks"

A total of 47 BIPOC participants who are currently working or have worked in the field of marine science were recruited using a non-probability snowball sampling method to participate in semi-structured interviews which were analyzed using Astin’s Input-Environment-Output framework and Social Cognitive Career Theory. Several interventions which have been put in place to address the systemic issues that have led to the exclusion of certain groups including BIPOC-focused programs, research experiences and mentorship were identified as having positive impacts on the cognitive-personal outcomes of sense of belonging (feeling of acceptance within a group), science identity (the self-categorization of one’s self as a ‘science person’) and self-efficacy (belief in one’s ability to succeed). Several factors including discrimination, lack of allyship and negative research or mentorship experiences were identified as factors that greatly reduce these cognitive-personal outcomes. In addition, all three interviewees who left the field of marine science mentioned research experiences where they felt unsupported as a contributing factor to them leaving the field.

Especially, these consumer-targeted traits pursued in GE applications could rise consumer acceptance. Consumer-targeted traits coupled with transgene-free crops has created a more balanced risk-benefit perception and given momentum to GE foods production. Nevertheless, the public has failed to distinguish bio-technologies, and regulators are treating GM and GE foods alike. Thus, it is vital to increase knowledge, communication and policy orientation.

While social distancing might become a long-term practice and consumers are adapting to the new lifestyle, behavioural research is needed to promote consumers’ adoption of contactless technologies. The objective of this study is to investigate the psychological determinants of emerging contactless technologies by synthesising theoretical insights from two behavioural precepts: (i) health belief model comprising constructs such as perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, self-efficacy, and (ii) technology acceptance model consisting of constructs such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A questionnaire survey is conducted to collect data from 508 consumers. The data are analysed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. The results show that health belief factors and technological characteristics contribute to the willingness to adopt contactless technologies. This research enriches behavioural research by providing a coherent and fitting explanation on consumers’ acceptance of contactless technologies. Practically, strategy implications regarding innovation-supportive environment creation, resources and training provision and end-customer demand satisfaction are provided to support contactless technology adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contactless technologies; COVID-19; health belief model; technology acceptance model","COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; health belief; modeling; technology adoption"

Such recognition has given rise to many STI policy initiatives across various areas of science and policy, leading to a better understanding of coronavirus and the development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics. However, the practical implementation of vaccine and treatment strategies within local communities extends well beyond the laboratory. This study explored how misinformation and trust amplify or attenuate coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine perceptions of those from ethnic minority groups deemed more susceptible to the impacts of the virus. Primary data in this study were collected in Scotland through semistructured interviews with 26 expert and nonexpert members from Scotland’s minority ethnic communities. The study findings show that risk perception is fluid and dependent on the information and evidential environment in which people find themselves. Misinformation, fake news, conspiracies, and trust or distrust (from prior experiences and historic practices) influence the perception of coronavirus and how risk messages are received, including the acceptance of coronavirus vaccines. This article reflects on Scotland’s approach to building trust and COVID-19 vaccine confidence and engagement based on the findings of this study, identifying areas of strength and areas for further improvement or research.

The study was designed as a mixed method and included the following research tools: questionnaires for data collection that were sent via email and semi-structured interviews of nurses, chosen voluntarily and randomly. The data were collected from 214 questionnaires in total, using technology acceptance model questionnaires, and the professional self-identity questionnaire (PSIQ). Moreover, data was collected from 10 in-depth interviews. Subsequently, the data was analyzed to understand the influence of personal, professional, and social factors concerning the usage of computer technology in nursing. The study was undertaken within the understanding that the participation of nurses is essential for the creation of sustainable developments, such as the use of computer technology, eventually leading to an improvement in the quality of care and the health of the community. Years of seniority in nursing, ease of use of technology, technology relevant to the job, and higher output quality, were associated with the most perceived benefits of using technology in a positive correlation. Relative to nurses’ sense of professionalism, there is an understanding that adopting new behavioral functions for their role will lead to promoting the quality of care and improving the health of the community.

However, perceived usefulness had no effect on the intention to use RPA. The result suggested that even if the respondents perceived RPA to be useful, they have little intention to use RPA in their task automation. Nevertheless, this study could contribute to the literature of RPA adoption in the accounting field by providing the theoretical base for examining the perception of accounting personnel on the intention to use RPA through an extended TAM.

An outstanding example is that of southwestern Brazilian Amazon, where government-owned tractors are accessed mainly via borrowing by grassroots associations, but also via tractor service supplied by local governments. The economic feasibility of the policy was appraised with a discrete choice experiment and a critical examination of implementation issues was pursued based in a qualitative survey. The results attested that policy was efficient strictly with association-based administration and without banning fires. Nevertheless, efficient tractor subsidy was justified as an enhancement of smallholders' welfare but not strictly as compensation for a reduced right to burn. That the policy changes offered were seen as better than the absence of change was probably due to complimentary public services, such as road infrastructure, been perceived as insufficient. Two extra tractor hours per farm were enough to ensure acceptance of a half month delay in the fire season opening. In complement, practical policy failures were observed, including tractor maintenance cost fitting neither associations nor government budgets, associations lacking social capital, providing tractors in a more costly basis and not being capable to enforce contracts for hiring pilots. The attested inefficiency of a near ban on fires parallels failures of similarly severe constraints attempted in multiple developing countries and it may also harm the livelihoods of smallholders. Conclusively, although mechanized tillage is not a fast way towards a large replacement of agricultural fires, it is nevertheless recommendable if improved in its implementation and planned for a time horizon comprising many years. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amazon; Cost-benefit analysis; Discrete choice experiment; Fire; Mechanized tillage; Self-management","agricultural production; agricultural research; agricultural technology; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; discrete choice analysis; economic analysis; fire behavior; fire management; grassroots level; local government; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; smallholder; tillage; Amazonia; Brazil"

Each energy source and respective technologies have specific techno-economic and environmental characteristics as well as social implications. This paper presents a comprehensive approach for prospective sustainability assessment of energy technologies developed within the Helmholtz Initiative “Energy System 2050” (ES2050). Methods: The “ES2050 approach” comprises environmental, economic, and social assessment. It includes established life cycle based economic and environmental indicators, and social indicators derived from a normative concept of sustainable development. The elaborated social indicators, i.e. patent growth rate, acceptance, and domestic value added, address three different socio-technical areas, i.e. innovation (patents), public perception (acceptance), and public welfare (value added). Results: The implementation of the “ES2050 approach” is presented exemplarily and different sustainability indicators and respective results are discussed based on three emerging technologies and corresponding case studies: (1) synthetic biofuels for mobility; (2) hydrogen from wind power for mobility; and (3) batteries for stationary energy storage. For synthetic biofuel, the environmental advantages over fossil gasoline are most apparent for the impact categories Climate Change and Ionizing Radiation—human health. Domestic value added accounts for 66% for synthetic biofuel compared to 13% for fossil gasoline. All hydrogen supply options can be considered to become near to economic competitiveness with fossil fuels in the long term. Survey participants regard Explosion Hazard as the most pressing concern about hydrogen fuel stations. For Li-ion batteries, the results for patent growth rate indicate that they enter their maturity phase. Conclusions: The “ES2050 approach” enables a consistent prospective sustainability assessment of (emerging) energy technologies, supporting technology developers, decision-makers in politics, industry, and society with knowledge for further evaluation, steering, and governance. The approach presented is considered rather a starting point than a blueprint for the comprehensive assessment of renewable energy technologies though, especially for the suggested social indicators, their significance and their embedding in context scenarios for prospective assessments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing (LCC); Social indicators; Sustainability assessment","Biofuels; Climate change; Costs; Decision making; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Hydrogen storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Patents and inventions; Surveys; Sustainable development; Wind power; Energy systems; Energy technologies; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Patent growth rates; Prospectives; Social indicators; Sustainability assessment; Synthetic biofuels; Life cycle; biomass; energy storage; life cycle analysis; social indicator; sustainability"

In line with this, technology acceptance is of great importance as resistance from the public can slow down or hinder the construction of energy technology projects. The current study assesses the social acceptance of three energy technologies relevant for the German energy transition: stationary battery storage, biofuel production plants and hydrogen fuel station. Methods: An online survey was conducted to examine the public’s general and local acceptance of energy technologies. Explored factors included general and local acceptance, public concerns, trust in relevant stakeholders and attitudes towards financial support. Results: The results indicate that general acceptance for all technologies is slightly higher than local acceptance. In addition, we discuss which public concerns exist with regard to the respective technologies and how they are more strongly associated with local than general acceptance. Further, we show that trust in stakeholders and attitudes towards financial support is relatively high across the technologies discussed. Conclusions: Taken together, the study provides evidence for the existence of a “general–local” gap, despite measuring general and local acceptance at the same level of specificity using a public sample. In addition, the collected data can provide stakeholders with an overview of worries that might need to be addressed when planning to implement a certain energy project. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery storage; Biofuel production plant; Energy transition; Hydrogen fuel station; Sustainability; Technology acceptance","Biofuels; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Sustainable development; Battery storage; Biofuel production; Biofuel production plant; Energy technologies; Energy transitions; Hydrogen fuel stations; Local acceptance; Production plant; Social acceptance; Technology acceptance; Social aspects; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; assessment method; energy planning; fossil fuel; stakeholder; Germany"

Within the context of the “Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology” (UTAUT) modified model, considering the upcoming demand and increase in demand for mobile-banking applications, the researcher tried to explore the theoretical concept between random people of various states in India. The primary data was collected by preparing a questionnaire and circulating it using Google Forms. The collected data was further coded into Smart PLS 4 to understand the model and structural equation with reference to mobile-banking technological adoption and factors that had a significant impact. The conclusions derived from the study is that social influence, “effort expectancy”, and “trust” factors had a very strong influence on the “purchase intention”, whereas “effort” and “risk” factors had a negligible impact on purchase intent. It was also found that the UTAUT model is appropriate for evaluating the technological adoption of mobile-banking applications. With the advent of many players in the market and their unique banking management applications on mobile platforms, consumers are moving towards different third-party app than their origin bank in which they hold account. This has forced banking institutions to up the pace in the competition, introducing a lot of new features. It is also important to understand that, as a customer, there are a lot of attributes that he would be looking into for adoption.

However, the uncontrolled and unprecedented use of plastic comes to its end. The global ban on plastic brings significant changes in technology but even more so in civil perception—changes taking place before our eyes. The aim of this study was to find answers to the questions about the readiness of consumers for a global ban on plastic. Within the research, the differences in consumer acceptance in countries in Europe, South and North America and Asia and the expression of social readiness to change attitudes towards plastic food packaging were analyzed. This work sketches the legal framework related to limiting the use of one-use food packaging made of fossil raw materials at the level of the European Union, Poland and Portugal but also at the level of the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States, as well as lower-income countries, e.g., Ukraine and Brazil. The survey results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The performed study demonstrates that, in in all the surveyed countries, appropriate legal acts related to the reduction of plastic in everyday life are already in place. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the full understanding of plastic banning in all surveyed countries. Consumers are aware that every effort should be made to prevent the world from drowning in plastic waste. Society is, in general, open to the use of bioplastics produced from the second-generation resource if second-generation bioplastics contribute to environmental and pollution reduction targets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bioplastic; consumer acceptance; food waste; snowball sampling","biodegradable plastic; plastic; consumption behavior; environmental management; food waste; plastic waste; polymer; waste management; adult; aged; Article; Asia; awareness; bakery product; Brazil; China; confectionary; consumer acceptance; consumer attitude; consumer readiness; Eastern Europe; educational status; environmental aspects and related phenomena; European Union; female; food packaging; global ban; human; legal aspect; low income country; male; North America; perception; Poland; Portugal; snowball sample; social status; Ukraine; United States; Western Europe; young adult; Europe; Plastics"

Across the globe, there is also a growing interest in the direct consumption of treated wastewater. Whilst the requisite technology is well established and safety can be guaranteed, the instigators of these projects still anticipate consumer resistance. However, there are currently few studies that provide insight into the public acceptance of treated wastewater. Moreover, the results of these studies are often inconsistent or inconclusive, particularly in regard to the relationship between the acceptance of wastewater reuse and environmental concern. Using representative survey data gathered from 300 respondents living in Flanders, Belgium, we show that water conservation behaviour and a sense of environmental group-efficacy positively affect public acceptance. Our study also demonstrates that feelings of disgust and fear of contamination are key drivers of consumer resistance to wastewater reuse and potentially override environmental concern. In the discussion, we propose an alternative approach to better understand consumer's environmental attitudes and their resistance to the use of treated wastewater.

In the case of autonomous crop robots, recent research from Germany suggests that societal acceptance of the technology plays an important role for farmer acceptance of crop robots. Yet little research has been conducted so far into how the public perceives autonomous agricultural technologies like crop robots. Investigating the public's opinion on crop robots will provide answers to one of farmers’ questions in the decision to invest in crop robots. Through consumer segmentation and hypotheses-based characterization, specific consumer groups with differing attitudes towards crop robots are identified. Two discrete choice experiments on digital and autonomous methods of weed management (n = 675) and tractor size and degree of autonomy (n = 645), conducted as part of a larger representative consumer survey in Germany (n = 2,012), are submitted to a Hierarchical Bayes estimation and subsequent latent class analysis. The identified consumer segments are characterized in a hypotheses-based approach with hypotheses centering on consumer attitudes measured as 5-point Likert-type items and as spontaneous image associations. Both subsamples can be segmented into three groups, which are comparable between the experiments in their socio-economic composition. Results suggest that the German public is largely positively inclined towards autonomous agricultural technologies. The method of weed control is considered more important than the vehicle type (i.e., conventional tractor or crop robot) and vehicle size is considered more important than degree of autonomy. Only the respective smallest consumer segments in the two experiments indicate indifference or a more conservative perspective. Participants’ attitude towards environmental preservation appears to have a positive influence on their evaluation of autonomous agricultural technologies. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first investigation into the public opinion of crop robots, based on a large sample representative of the German population in four socio-demographic variables. It indicates that the German population is most interested in the reduction of agrochemicals in plant production and will also accept autonomous agricultural technologies to achieve this goal. Policymakers should make use of these insights when communicating about novel technologies in agriculture and extension agents should relay this information to farmers, particularly those already interested in investing in crop robots. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance; Digitalization; Discrete choice experiment; Field robots; Latent class analysis; Preference","Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural technology; Economic and social effects; Robots; Social aspects; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Weed control; Acceptance; Agricultural technologies; Consumer segments; Degree of autonomy; Digitalization; Discrete choice experiments; Field robot; Latent class analysis; Preference; Public opinions; Crops; agricultural technology; autonomy; digitization; experimental study; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; robotics; segmentation; weed control; Germany"

Students’ acceptance of eLearning is important because it is associated with their engagement in the online teaching–learning environment. This study used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2: Venkatesh et al., 2012) to determine the factors predicting the behavioral intention of university students' to use eLearning platforms in the post-pandemic era. UTAUT2 was extended to include the constructs ‘Learning Value’ and ‘Empowerment in Learning’. 314 students from different universities across Greece participated by completing an online questionnaire. Performance Expectancy, Social Influence, Hedonic Motivation, Learning Value and Habit had a significant impact on students’ intention to use eLearning platforms to learn, while Facilitating Conditions and Learning Value had a direct impact on actual use. The findings enhance the research applying the UTAUT2 model, with the Learning Value, for the investigation of students’ intention to use eLearning platforms in the post-Covid era.

Hydrogen blending and repurposing the national grid to supply low-carbon hydrogen gas may offer respective short- and long-term solutions to achieving emissions reduction across parts of the housing sector. Despite this imperative, the social acceptance of domestic hydrogen energy technologies remains underexplored by sustainability scholars, with limited insights regarding consumer perceptions and expectations of the transition. A knowledge deficit of this magnitude is likely to hinder effective policymaking and may result in sub-optimal rollout strategies that derail the trajectory of the net zero agenda. Addressing this knowledge gap, this study develops a conceptual framework for examining the consumer-facing side of the hydrogen transition. The paper affirms that the spatiotemporal patterns of renewable energy adoption are shaped by a range of interacting scales, dimensions, and factors. The UK's emerging hydrogen landscape and its actor-network is characterized as a heterogenous system, composed of dynamic relationships and interdependencies. Future studies should engage with domestic hydrogen acceptance as a co-evolving, multi-scalar phenomenon rooted in the interplay of five distinct dimensions: attitudinal, sociopolitical, community, market, and behavioral acceptance. If arrived to, behavioral acceptance helps realize the domestication of hydrogen heating and cooking, established on grounds on cognitive, sociopolitical, and sociocultural legitimacy. The research community should internalize the complexity and richness of consumer attitudes and responses, through a more critical and reflexive approach to the study of social acceptance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical approaches; Decarbonization; Domestic hydrogen; Hydrogen energy; Hydrogen transition; Social acceptance","Blending; Climate change; Emission control; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Housing; Hydrogen; Social aspects; Critical approach; Decarbonisation; Domestic hydrogen; Energy acceptances; Fuel source; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen transition; Renewable energies; Residential sectors; Social acceptance; Decarbonization; alternative energy; climate change; conceptual framework; domestication; natural gas; sustainability; trajectory"

Design/methodology/approach: The simulation environment is established by integrating virtual reality interface with a micro-simulation model. In the simulation, the vehicle autonomy is developed by a framework that integrates artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. Human-subject experiments are carried, and participants are asked to virtually sit in the developed autonomous vehicle (AV) that allows for both human driving and autopilot functions within a mixed traffic environment. Findings: Not surprisingly, the inconsistency is identified between two driving modes, in which the AV’s driving maneuver causes the cognitive bias and makes participants feel unsafe. Even though only a shallow portion of the cases that the AV ended up with an accident during the testing stage, participants still frequently intervened during the AV operation. On a similar note, even though the statistical results reflect that the AV drives under perceived high-risk conditions, rarely an actual crash can happen. This suggests that the classic safety surrogate measurement, e.g. time-to-collision, may require adjustment for the mixed traffic flow. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the behavior of AVs and the behavioral difference between AVs and human drivers are important, where the developed platform is only the first effort to identify the critical scenarios where the AVs might fail to react. Practical implications: This paper attempts to fill the existing research gap in preparing close-to-reality tools for AV experience and further understanding human behavior during high-level autonomous driving. Social implications: This work aims to systematically analyze the inconsistency in driving patterns between manual and autopilot modes in various driving scenarios (i.e. multiple scenes and various traffic conditions) to facilitate user acceptance of AV technology.

This brings long-term environmental, economic and societal benefits to cities. However, shared AVs will not only need to overcome technological challenges but also prevail against social barriers for successful marketplace penetration. Hence, we proposed and investigated the acceptance of four shared AV service designs for public use in this study, namely, autonomous buses, shuttles, AV rideshares and autonomous or robo-taxis. An online survey conducted in Singapore with 734 adults found the greatest receptiveness toward the introduction of autonomous shuttles, in part due to perceptions that they will perform well and be easy to adopt. This aligns with ongoing shared AV trials where AV shuttles are mostly used. Larger autonomous buses had the second-highest acceptance. AV rideshares and taxis seem to largely appeal to the existing regular users of the conventional counterparts of these services. These results suggest that to encourage a mode switch from public transport to ridesharing and taxis, or vice versa, shared AVs need to appeal to users beyond being an automated version of existing modes. That is, shared AVs need to address an underserved or unmet transportation need or population. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","mode preference; public transit; self-driving vehicles; shared autonomous vehicles; technology acceptance","autonomous underwater vehicle; environmental economics; public transport; taxis; Singapore"

This study aimed to explore the impact of e-marketing factors for agricultural products on the sustainable consumer behaviour. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model were used to investigate the factors that trigger long-term behavioural changes towards more sustainable consumer behaviour. Trust and continuance intention (CI) constitute sustainable consumer behaviours. The survey-based data were collected from 172 farmers in and around the Al-Baha province of Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that, out of the six factors, social influence (SI), hedonic motives (HM), and perceived risk (PR) had a significant impact on trust whereas the perceived usefulness (PU), information quality (IQ), and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) had an insignificant impact on trust. Trust appears to had a substantial positive impact on the development of CI. Furthermore, the significant moderation of age and the insignificant moderation of education are observed among trust–CI relationship. Therefore, policymakers should concentrate on the factors such as SI and decrease the factors that are related to the PR in order to achieve a higher level of trust.

This change raised the need for smart home health care services (SHHSs) and their extension to everyday life. However, the factors influencing the acceptance behavior of SHHSs have been inadequately investigated and failed to address why users have the intention to use and adopt the services. This study aimed to analyze the influential factors and measure the behavioral acceptance of SHHSs in South Korea. This study adopted the integrated model of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and task–technology fit (TTF) to understand the behavioral acceptance of SHHSs from users’ perceptions and task–technology fit. Multiple-item scales were established based on validated previous measurement scales and adjusted in accordance with SHHS context. Data from 487 valid samples were analyzed statistically, applying partial least square structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the integrated acceptance model explained 55.2% of the variance in behavioral intention, 44.9% of adoption, and 62.5% of the continuous intention to use SHHSs, supporting 11 of the 13 proposed hypotheses. Behavioral intention was positively influenced by users’ perceptions on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and functional conditions. Task–technology fit significantly influenced performance expectancy and behavioral intention, validating the linkage between the two models. Meanwhile, task characteristics were insignificant to determine task–technology fit, which might stem from complex home health care needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were not sufficiently resolved by current service technologies. The findings implied that the acceptance of SHHSs needs to be evaluated according to both the user perceptions of technologies and the matching fit of task and technology. Theoretically, this study supports the applicability of the integrated model of UTAUT and TTF to the domain of SHHS, and newly proposed the measurement items of TTF reflecting the domain specificity of SHHS, providing empirical evidence during the pandemic era in South Korea. Practically, the results could suggest to the planners and strategists of home health care services how to promote SHHS in one’s health management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","partial least square structural equation modeling; smart home health care; task technology fit (TTF); technology acceptance; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","health monitoring; health services; perception; performance assessment; technology adoption; theoretical study; adoption; adult; Article; convergent validity; coronavirus disease 2019; descriptive research; discriminant validity; female; health care quality; health service; home care; home environment; human; human experiment; integrated health care system; internal consistency; Likert scale; male; marriage; partial least squares regression; patient attitude; social support; South Korea; task technology fit; telemedicine; test retest reliability; theoretical model; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; epidemiology; pandemic; technology; COVID-19; Home Care Services; Humans; Pandemics; Republic of Korea; Technology"

While the science of nanotechnology is indicated to offer improvements to conventional vineyard inputs and operations, its acceptability by potential users and consumers has an impact on the governance of nano-enabled agriculture. This governance takes place not just at the state level through regulation and policy, but also through corporate, and community sectors' use of branding and narratives about nanotechnology and nano-based agrichemicals, and the (non)consumption of nano-enabled products. This paper investigates the technical and market acceptability, or governance, of nanotechnology by elucidating the attitudes of industry gatekeepers towards wines grown with nanotechnology. This necessarily informs the ‘market permissibility’ of such technologies, and illuminates sensitivities, concerns, and consumer-based barriers to adoption. We conducted 15 semi-structured, key informant interviews and a thematic data analysis. Our results suggest a high level of technical acceptability, particularly if environmental sustainability benefits are made clear. Wine producers are interested in nano-solutions to labour, pest and disease, and cost of production issues. However, key actors in the production-consumption network of New Zealand wine have concerns about nano-enabled approaches. Regulatory approval and safety assurances are expected prior to adoption in food or wine. Respondents argue that consumer acceptability is less clear, and that thought leaders like wine writers, intermediaries and ‘influencers’ will be critical in shaping public opinion.

Despite several benefits of green innovation adoption (GIA), the adoption rate of these initiatives is still abysmal in manufacturing organisations. To fill this gap, we have developed and validated the GIA model grounded on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), which compels organisations to implement these novel technologies. Data was collected through a survey of 516 respondents from Pakistani manufacturing industries and analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) and the artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The deliverables of SEM and ANN approaches demonstrated that all green integrated constructs of the research model, such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, social influence, facilitating conditions, and innovation cost, predict green behavioural intention (GBI). Besides, GBI was found to have a strong direct and mediating effect among integrated constructs towards GIA. In addition, the moderation of organisational size highlighted the differentiation among small, medium and large size enterprises. Additionally, ANN specifies the robustness and relative importance of all integrated constructs, whereas green facilitating conditions have the highest relative importance value for GIA.

This study fills this gap by unpacking teenagers' learning management system (LMS) acceptance patterns through three-step latent profile analysis (LPA). The results of LPA on a survey of 1180 junior secondary students from 25 Hong Kong school identified three profiles, namely: Reluctant Pattern (8%), Embracing Pattern (61%), and Affirmative Pattern (31%), with ascending acceptance of LMS. A number of contextual factors were identified as antecedents of LMS acceptance, including school factors (i.e., school banding), family factors (i.e., family socio-economic status (SES), family environment, and both parents' parenting styles), and personal factors (i.e., gender, experience, conceptions of learning, and ICT literacy). All the antecedents were significantly associated with profile membership, except for family SES and experience. In addition, the three acceptance patterns also affected consequences of LMS acceptance, represented by LMS continued use and use satisfaction.

An integrated model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM) was modified and utilized with a sample of 473 cyclists in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The results confirm that the awareness change because of the advent of COVID-19, especially related to the environment, negative impacts of motorized vehicles (including road safety burden), and climate change issues, has the strongest power to influence bicycle use intention. The positive effect of COVID-19 also significantly influenced subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Meanwhile, attitudes toward cycling and its perceived usefulness did not significantly contribute to bicycle use intention. Attitudes to use bicycles also could not mediate the relationship between COVID-19 and the intention to use bicycles. Based on the study findings, a set of policy initiatives was proposed, including cycling campaigns related to environmental issues, promoting bicycle use by public figures, providing a segregated bike lane, and introducing bicycle-specific programs, such as bicycle usage in cultural events. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bicycle; COVID-19; Intention to use; Technology acceptance model; Theory of planned behavior","Bicycles; Climate change; Motor transportation; Sporting goods; Indonesia; Integrated modeling; Intention to use; Motorized vehicles; Power; Psychosocial factors; Road safety; Technology acceptance model; Theory of Planned Behavior; Use intentions; COVID-19"

Thus, the aim of this study is to explore Egyptian consumers’ continued ride-hailing apps usage intention, as well as factors forming their attitudes toward these apps. Moreover, the study investigates the moderation role of age, gender, and income. To achieve this aim, this study integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the innovation diffusion theory (IDT), along with two personal characteristics, including personal innovativeness and environmental awareness. To test the proposed research model, data were collected online from 379 existing ride-hailing service users in Egypt. Then, Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was utilised to analyse the collected data and test the research hypotheses. The results confirm that consumers’ attitudes are critical predictors of their continuance intentions to use ride-hailing apps. Furthermore, the results indicate that consumers’ attitudes towards ride-hailing apps are determined by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived risk, perceived enjoyment, compatibility, interactivity, and personal innovativeness. However, the study shows that observability and environmental awareness do not play a significant role in forming consumers’ attitudes towards ride-hailing apps. Moreover, gender and age differences exist in terms of the strength of certain relationships. The research results provide transportation network companies (TNCs) with valuable suggestions on how to understand their current consumers’ needs. Thus, they can improve their platforms to satisfy their consumers’ expectations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intention; Ride-hailing; Shared mobility; Sharing economy; Travel behaviour",""

However, research on the application of RWHs in humid regions is necessary because they may also face the challenges of water supply shortages, urban flooding, runoff pollution, and heat island phenomena. Public acceptance plays a key role in the reuse of water resources. This study takes Shanghai, China, as an example and explores the public intention and motivation to use RWHs in humid regions by adding six psychological factors to the technology acceptance model (TAM). The results indicate that social influence, subjective knowledge, and the technological environment are direct drivers. Other psychological factors influence the intention to use through the moderation of perceived usefulness and attitude. The total effect of social influence, subjective knowledge, and social trust are essential for RWHs implementation. However, the technical environment and perceived risk may be psychological barriers to accepting RWHs. In addition, there is no significant effect of the perceived cost. The findings provide critical insights for policymakers to understand the public's attitudes and intrinsic motivations to address the challenges of rainwater harvesting in a humid region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Humid region; Intention to use; Psychological factors; Rainwater harvesting; Technology acceptance model","rain; heat island; humid environment; psychology; rainwater; runoff; water supply; Article; attitude; China; conceptual framework; flooding; human; intrinsic motivation; knowledge; psychological aspect; social aspect; technology; city; heat; procedures; Shanghai; Cities; Hot Temperature; Rain; Water Supply"

The challenge presented by COVID-19 is broad, rapidly evolving, and complex; it threatens everyone’s well-being, the global economy, the environment, and all societal and cultural standards and our daily activities. Throughout the Coronavirus outbreak and any future lockdowns, it is crucial that the needs of students be ultimately and regularly met and that they are supported effectively. We intend to address skill shortages and mismatches, particularly regarding the readiness to teach in an online environment that encourages flexible and innovative learning. The main contribution of this paper is addressing this subject with an integrated vision of three different players in higher education: students, teachers and librarians. Using the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a conceptual model was developed to explain both the behavior and intentions of users when using e-learning systems. Among Portuguese students, 91% of e-learning satisfaction can be attributed to perceived usefulness, actual use, and personal considerations. For educators, satisfaction appears to be mostly dependent on perceived usefulness and usability, while librarians’ satisfaction is negatively dependent on technological factors. Students’ actual use of technology is 89% dependent on organizational and technological variables. However, the actual use by teachers appears to be primarily dependent on personal and technological factors. Similarly, 91% of the variability of the use of e-learning tools by librarians can be explained by organizational, personal and technological factors, with the personal factors having a negative impact on the actual use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital contents; e-learning; librarians; teachers and students; technology adoption models",""

Virtual reality technology in marine ecotourism (VRTME) enhances the travel experiences of those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study adopts Maslow's hierarchy of motivational needs and the technology acceptance model to investigate the factors influencing consumers' behavioural intention (BI) towards VRTME and examines their interrelationships. An online survey was conducted with 451 people, and the results were analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings show how motivational constructs, namely, environmental knowledge, biospheric values, risk perception of marine pollution, social susceptibility, and green self-image, as mediated by perceived usefulness (PU), affect the adoption of VRTME. Perceived ease of use (PEOU) further impacted PU. The total effect analysis indicated that PU had the strongest influence, followed by PEOU, social susceptibility, biospheric values, environmental knowledge, green self-image, and risk perception of marine pollution. To substantiate the constructs motivating BI, this study combined two disparate research paradigms centred on the environmental needs and technological characteristics of VRTME. Overall, this study contributes to the existing literature on consumers' adoption of VRTME by introducing new perspectives and recommending policies to raise public awareness and support ongoing conservation efforts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioural intention; COVID-19; Marine ecotourism; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; Technology acceptance model; Virtual reality","Biospherics; Ecosystems; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Virtual reality; Behavioral intention; Consumer adoptions; Environmental knowledge; Marine ecotourism; Maslow hierarchy of need; Maslow's Hierarchy; Perceived usefulness; Public awareness; Technology acceptance model; Virtual reality technology; COVID-19"

However, the implementation may encounter resistance, since the uncertainty surrounding novel technology may raise anxiety, and persuasion efforts to promote use can evoke reactance. Thereby, anxiety and reactance are two forms of resistance to new technology. Little is known about the role of resistance over the course of the innovation implementation process, in a social environment where technology functionality depends on adoption by others. Therefore, this four-wave longitudinal study followed adoption of the Dutch COVID-19 contact tracing app during four months (N = 1120), and explored the time dynamics and interplay of reactance to freedom threat, anxiety, and perceived social norms on app use. Mixed-effect analyses showed that anxiety and, subtly, reactance decreased with time; initial freedom threat predicted later reactance. App use related negatively to reactance and anxiety; and positively to positive social norms. Over time, the norm effect was mediated by lower reactance and anxiety. The results imply that resistance is pervasive, suggest that self-perceived app use norms may be key to overcoming resistance to new applications, and demonstrate that theories predicting innovation or technology acceptance benefit from studying predictors over time. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contact tracing apps; Innovation diffusion; Psychological reactance; Technology acceptance; Technology anxiety","Contact tracing; Contact tracing app; Implementation process; Innovations diffusion; Mobile applications; Psychological reactances; Social context; Social norm; Technology acceptance; Technology anxiety"

The use of these practices may be influenced by various psychological and social factors. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to design an integrated model for strawberry growers’ behavior toward implementation of good agricultural practices (GAPs) in Iran. The research framework was developed by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM). The integrated model was empirically tested using data collected from a survey of 200 strawberry growers. The findings of structural equation modeling showed that perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived behavior control (PBC), and behavioral intention (BI) of strawberry growers significantly influenced the behavior of growers toward using GAPs (BGAPs). These factors explained 30% of the variance in behavior of growers to use GAPs. The study also supported the significant indirect effect of perceived usefulness (PU), PEU, subjective norms, PBC, and attitudes on BGAPs. Overall, the calculated total effects of factors on BGAPs indicated that PBC, PEU, and behavioral intention were the three important determinants of growers’ behavior to use GAPs, respectively.

Following that, business operations started shifting away from traditional to advance digitalized processes. These digitalized processes gave a further boost to the e-commerce industry, making the online environment more competitive. Despite the growing trend, there has always been a consumer market that is not involved in online shopping, and this gap is huge when it comes to consumers from developing countries, specifically Pakistan. On contrary, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes to the way consumers used to form their intention and behave toward digitalized solutions in pre COVID-19 times. Evidence shows that the global e-commerce industry has touched phenomenal growth during COVID-19, whereas Pakistan's e-commerce industry still holds a huge potential and has not fully boomed yet. These facts pave new avenues for marketers to cater to this consumer market for long-term growth. Hence, the study provides insights into how consumers' online buying behavior has transformed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Pakistan. The study presents a framework based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Furthermore, the moderating role of gender and payment mode has also been examined. For the analysis of variables, the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to conduct structural equation modeling (SEM) by collecting data from 266 respondents. The results show a significant and positive impact of perceived benefits, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and social influence on consumers' intention, but they also show an insignificant impact of gender and payment mode as a moderating variable on PEOU-BI and BI-AB, respectively. The results are of utmost significance for Pakistani businesses, marketers, and e-traders to streamline their business practices accordingly. Lastly, the proposed framework demonstrates new directions for future research to work upon. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","actual behavior; behavioral intention; gender; payment mode; perceived benefits; perceived ease of use; perceived enjoyment; social influence",""

Noise has been identified as one of the key concerns for public acceptance. Although substantial research has been carried out to better understand the sound source generation mechanisms in drones, important questions remain about the requirements for operational procedures and regulatory frameworks. An important issue is that drones operate within different airspace, closer to communities than conventional aircraft, and that the noise produced is highly tonal and contains a greater proportion of high-frequency broadband noise compared with typical aircraft noise. This is likely to cause concern for exposed communities due to impacts on public health and well-being. This paper presents a modelling framework for setting recommendations for drone operations to minimise community noise impact. The modelling framework is based on specific noise targets, e.g., the guidelines at a receiver position defined by WHO for sleep quality inside a residential property. The main assumption is that the estimation of drone noise exposure indoors is highly relevant for informing operational constraints to minimise noise annoyance and sleep disturbance. This paper illustrates the applicability of the modelling framework with a case study, where maximum A-weighted sound pressure levels (Formula presented.) and sound exposure levels (Formula presented.) as received in typical indoor environments are used to define drone-façade minimum distance to meet WHO recommendations. The practical and scalable capabilities of this modelling framework make it a useful tool for inferring and assessing the impact of drone noise through compliance with appropriate guideline noise criteria. It is considered that with further refinement, this modelling framework could prove to be a significant tool in assisting with the development of noise metrics, regulations specific to drone operations and the assessment of future drone operations and associated noise. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","community noise impact; drone noise; noise annoyance; noise metrics; noise regulation; sleep disturbance","aircraft; noise; noise pollution; policy development; public health; sleep; unmanned vehicle; World Health Organization; human; sleep disorder; Aircraft; Humans; Noise; Public Health; Sleep Wake Disorders; Unmanned Aerial Devices"

This study integrated two distinct values, namely perceived social values and perceived personal values, with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine how different values shape college students’ pro-environmental behavioral intentions. The proposed model was then empirically validated using survey data from 245 responses from freshmen students at a University in Chongqing. The findings reveal that while perceived social values and perceived personal values are both positively related to behavioral intention, the effect sizes of the former are much larger.

Consequently, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning in Sweden enforced a prohibition of new installations of old wood stoves in 2017 to protect the public health. The prohibition caused a public backlash that organized itself as a “wood stove rising”, eventually leading to a cancellation of the new legislation in 2019. We performed comprehensive interviews with 11 signatories of the original appeal to analyze the underlying motives for combating the implementation of this pro-environmental energy policy. We find that domestic heating through fire-making is an age-old human behavior that is deeply connected to several social and emotional human needs, but also to survival in remote areas with cold climate. The likelihood of policy observance and acceptance is higher if the policy is not perceived as being in direct conflict with these needs: basic emotion regulation, sensations of tradition and connection to other people, and means of crisis management for the individual. We also find that the protesters acted out of a sustainability perspective, albeit one where the continued use of functional devices was valued more than the perceived wear-and-tear of replacing outdated technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic heating; Emission regulation; Emotional motives; Pro-environmental legislation; Public acceptance; Public backlash","Environmental regulations; Fire resistance; Fires; Sustainable development; Wood; Domestic heating; Emissions regulations; Emotional motive; Environmental legislations; Pro-environmental legislation; Public acceptance; Public backlash; Reducing particle; Swedishs; Wood stove; Behavioral research; cooking appliance; particulate matter; public health; public sector; wood; Sweden"

Recognised journals of the Web of Science (WoS) database were searched with no time frame limit, and a total of 47 studies published between 2003 and 2021 were critically analysed. The key research findings revealed that in educational context a vast majority of selected studies explore the validity of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its many different extensions (N=37), along with TAM’s integrations with other contributing theories and models (N=5). It was exposed that among numerous predictors, thematically grouped into user aspects, task & technology aspects, and social aspects, self-efficacy, subjective norm, (perceived) enjoyment, facilitating conditions, (computer) anxiety, system accessibility, and (technological) complexity were the most frequent predictive factors (i.e. antecedents) affecting educational technology adoption. Considering types of technologies, e-learning was found to be the most common validated mode of delivery, followed by m-learning, Learning Management Systems (LMSs), and social media services.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an exploratory qualitative approach to understand the construct of trust in the context of the educational sector. Data were collected through semistructured questionnaires and online interviews. Findings: The research identified that, for most potential blockchain users, trust positively influences the HEIs, because benefits such as secure data sharing and transaction transparency could optimize the daily routine and avoid fraud in academic documents, providing a cooperative and reliable working environment. In addition, the results suggest that trust is needed to overcome challenges related to issues such as costs and privacy. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the advances in the emerging literature on blockchain in the educational sector as a system with the potential to generate trust, as well as the literature on the technology acceptance models. Practical implications: For HEI managers and practitioners, this study highlights the need for a greater understanding of the influence of trust in the relationships between HEIs and other stakeholders. Social implications: This work shows that adopting blockchain technologies would allow users to build social relationships of trust in a cooperative work environment and develop trusted behavior by sharing data securely and transparently.

Despite the undeniable wealth of socially assistive robots (SARs), there is an increasing need to customize the tools used for measuring their acceptance in real-life applications. Methods: Within the Robot-Era project, a scale was developed to understand the degree of acceptance of the robotic platform. A preliminary test with 21 participants was performed to assess the statistical validity of the Robot-Era Inventory (REI) scales. Results: Based on the criteria observed in the literature, 41 items were developed and grouped in different scales (perceived robot personality, human–robot interaction, perceived benefit, ease of use, and perceived usefulness). The reliability of the Robot-Era Inventory scale was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha, with a mean value of 0.79 (range = 0.61–0.91). Furthermore, the preliminary validity of this scale has been tested by using the correlation analysis with a gold standard, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Discussion: The Robot-Era Inventory represents a useful tool that can be easily personalized and included in the assessment of any SARs that cooperate with older people in real environment applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","embodiment; older people; scale validity; social assistive robotics; social presence; technology acceptance; usability","Economic and social effects; Human robot interaction; Assistive robotics; Design and Development; Embodiment; Older People; Scale validity; Social assistive robotic; Social presence; Socially assistive robots; Technology acceptance; Usability; Machine design; age distribution; aged; Article; educational status; female; human; human computer interaction; male; patient attitude; personal experience; personality; personalized medicine; rating scale; risk benefit analysis; Robot Era Inventory Scale; robotics; sex difference; social acceptance; social behavior; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; usability; validation study"

Results showed that CO<inf>2</inf>-based fuels were seen as an acceptable and beneficial technology and risks were perceived to be low.

In this context, digital fashion and virtual design have emerged. Although China has started to digitally distribute cultural products based on the digitization of museums, there is still a gap in the field of digital fashion. In order to achieve the sustainable development of Chinese traditional costume culture and explore the Sinicization of digital fashion, this article proposes to transfer Chinese traditional costumes into a series of digitalized commodities, serving as computer game skins for online sales. This research involved the construction of a hypothetical model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), including perceived usefulness, purchase price perceptions, perceived playfulness, cultural elements authenticity, satisfaction, and purchase intention through the related literature. In total, the survey data of 219 Chinese game players were collected, and a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to verify these research hypotheses. The results showed that perceived playfulness and cultural elements authenticity had a positive effect on the players’ satisfaction and purchase intentions, whereas perceived usefulness had a negative influence on the players’ satisfaction and purchase intentions. In addition, purchase price perceptions had no significant negative effect on the players’ satisfaction or their purchase intentions. Overall, this study contributes to the co-development of digital fashion and traditional costume culture in China, as well as the improvement of product design and marketing management for game companies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinese traditional costume; digital fashion; digitalized collection; online game; structural equation modeling; virtual game items","computer simulation; design; digitization; Internet; marketing; perception; secondary sector industry; sustainability; sustainable development; China"

Workplace interventions aimed at supporting employers in the prevention of mental ill-health in the workforce are urgently required. Managing Minds at Work is a digital intervention aimed at supporting line managers in promoting better mental health at work through a preventative approach. This intervention was developed as part of the Mental Health and Productivity Pilot, a wider initiative aimed at supporting employers across the Midlands region of the United Kingdom to improve the future of workplace mental health and wellbeing. The aim of the study is to describe the design and development of the Managing Minds at Work digital training program, prior to feasibility testing. We adopted a collaborative participatory design involving co-design (users as partners) and principles of user-centred design (pilot and usability testing). An agile methodology was used to co-create intervention content with a stakeholder virtual community of practice. Development processes were mapped to core elements of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The program covers five broad areas: (i) promoting self-care techniques among line managers; (ii) designing work to prevent work-related stress; (iii) management competencies to prevent and reduce stress; (iv) having conversations with employees about mental health; (v) building a psychologically safe work environment. It was considered by stakeholders to be appropriate for any type of organization, irrespective of their size or resources. Pilot and usability testing (n = 37 surveys) aligned with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) demonstrated that the program was perceived to be useful, relevant, and easy to use by managers across sectors, organization types, and sizes. We identified positive impacts on manager attitudes and behavioral intentions related to preventing mental ill-health and promoting good mental wellbeing at work. The next step is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of Managing Minds at Work with line managers in diverse employment settings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital; intervention; line managers; mental health; occupational; stress; training; workforce; workplace","health impact; mental disorder; mental health; occupational exposure; public health; workplace; article; clinical article; conversation; employee; employer; employment; feasibility study; human; human experiment; job stress; manager; medical research; productivity; psychological well-being; self care; training; United Kingdom; usability testing; user-centered design; wellbeing; work environment; workforce; organization; psychology; questionnaire; Humans; Mental Health; Organizations; Self Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace"

The goals of straw returning technology are to enable crop straw to decompose in soil to increase soil fertility and reduce air pollution. While the concept of straw returning has the potential to promote environmental sustainability, the successful implementation of straw returning highly depends on the satisfaction of rural households' motivational needs towards technology acceptance. This study posits a novel theoretical acceptance model for straw returning technology that integrated the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Norm Activation Model and systematically examines the factors affecting the acceptance of straw returning technology. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey among rural households was conducted for data collection in Northeast China, China's important grain production base. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used to test the effectiveness of the proposed acceptance model. Multi-group analyses were performed to examine whether the results were different or equivalent across different factors (e.g., education level, usage experience, and crop type). The results show that our model explains 83.2% of the variance in behavioral intention to use straw returning technology. Intention to use was positively affected by performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, personal norms, the ascription of responsibility directly, and effort expectancy indirectly. No significant effects of awareness of consequences on intention to use were found, and personal norms presented the largest total effects on behavioral intention. In addition, several hypothesized relations differed across rural households' characteristics and experience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural waste management; Norm activation model; Straw returning; Technology acceptance; UTAUT","Acceptance tests; Crops; Environmental technology; Least squares approximations; Surveys; Sustainable development; Waste management; Acceptance models; Activation models; Agricultural waste management; Intention to use; Norm activation model; Northeast China; Rural households; Straw returning; Technology acceptance; UTAUT; Chemical activation; recycling; rural area; soil fertility; technology adoption; waste management; adult; agricultural waste; Article; China; controlled study; crop production; cross-sectional study; educational status; female; household; human; male; personal experience; questionnaire; responsibility; rural population; social aspect; social norm; straw returning; theoretical study"

AI-assisted learning environments have been implemented in classrooms to facilitate the innovation of pedagogical models. However, college students' willingness to accept (WTA) AI-assisted learning environments has been ignored. Exploring the factors that influence college students' willingness to use AI can promote AI technology application in higher education. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the theory of perceived risk, this study identified six factors that influence students' willingness to use AI to analyze their relationships with WTA AI-assisted learning environments. A model including six hypotheses was constructed to test the factors affecting students' WTA. The results indicated that college students showed “weak rejection” of the construction of AI-assisted learning environments. Effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE), and social influence (SI) were all positively related to college students' WTA AI-assisted learning environments. Psychological risk (PR) significantly negatively influenced students' WTA. The findings of this study will be helpful for carrying out risk communication, which can promote the construction of AI-assisted learning environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-assisted learning environment; college students; perceived risk; UTAUT; willingness to accept",""

Teachers’ endeavours to conduct their courses online, the support they take during their endeavours, and their relationships with such basic components as the environment, content and students during this adaptation process will be revealed within the framework of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed. The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed (Creswell, 2009). The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. Findings: The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online courses have developed positively over the sub-dimensions of UTAUT, which are performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SE), facilitating conditions (FC) and behavioural intention (BI). The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online instruction process have a significant effect on PE, FC and BI on the basis of gender, and on PE and EE on the basis of course content quality. In the process whereby the ICT teachers carry out the ITS course online, the sub-dimensions of PE, SE and FC are significantly predictive of the BI. Research limitations/implications: UTAUT has been taken as a guiding framework in explaining and discussing the adaptations. Similarly, in other studies focussing on adaptation, this model could be employed in planning the research process. In addition, this study has followed a method in which qualitative data are mostly used to explain the quantitative data. Further studies may adopt a process whereby qualitative data are largely used to describe the way ITS course is conducted in online environments and this process may be used to develop a model. Practical implications: Examining the students’ BIs in online courses overlaps with the sub-dimension of PE in this study, which stresses that PE, EE and motivation are significantly and directly effective on the students’ intentions of using the online courses, while there is a difference between these two studies in terms of the dimension of EE. The factors such learning outcome, curriculum, attendance to the course, use of materials and tools, interaction and technological substructure appear to be affected by this dimension, so they could be taken as important in that they reveal the importance of the study. Originality/value: This study may provide clues for the online instruction practices that it reveals teachers’ adaptations to online learning environments at secondary schools. On the other hand, software, hardware, coding and robotics take place in the subjects like product designing, developing and programming that are within the content of ITS course for secondary schools. Even though there is a curriculum prepared for these subjects, a lot of different instruction techniques can be used for the teaching of these subjects. This can allow some inferences about the environments and methods suitable for the online instruction of the related subjects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ICT teachers; Information technologies and software course; Online instruction; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology",""

Second to test the awareness and cultural acceptance of societies in MENA region of the need to preserve the environment and reduce pollution by paving the way for finding alternatives to energy and developing emerging energy, which in turn will contribute to sustainable development and preserve the environment from pollution due to energy produced through fossil sources. The method of the current study relied on both primary data and secondary data. Hence, a questionnaire survey was developed to collect the required data. While, secondary data sources are obtained through the Web site finance.yahoo.com. The data processing techniques were carried out using Stata 16 software and using the Multiple Linear Regression method. The sample of the study consisted of 653 people from different MENA countries, i.e. Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. The results revealed two types of data, quantitative data and qualitative data. Quantitative data is excluded from the secondary data analysis that renewable energy technologies have a positive effect on sustainability development in the MENA region. Qualitative data; as the survey includes some open ended questions to give an avenue to respondents to provide further feedback regarding their experience and perception of renewable energy. The results revealed a high degree of cultural perception of Renewable Energy Technologies of the communities in the MENA. Also, people are aware and ready to afford the cost and efforts to generate clean energy that promote sustainability.

The drastic paradigm shift faced by the education sector is inevitable, especially as the impact of the much-touted Fourth Industrial Revolution is being felt in key sectors of the economy. This reality imposes the need for technology-enhanced learning for tertiary students as it represents the future of the workplace for which they are being prepared at university. For effective learning to take place, institutions need to incorporate technological tools in their teaching and learning. Adapting to a myriad of technology tools can be challenging, especially for less privileged learners who might be adjusting to tertiary life and previously have not been exposed to the basics of computers and other technology tools. This challenge is further compounded by the fact that most of these learners are experiencing the independence of tertiary education for the first time and are still struggling to balance their academic workload with the anxieties of social blending. This paper investigated how first-year students at a traditional, previously disadvantaged university in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa, adapted to Blackboard Learn (also referred to as WiseUP), the learning management system (LMS) adapted for blended learning at the university. The paper explored the challenges faced by the new students and thereafter employed a combination of the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Technology Acceptance Model to build a new model, which reveals the critical factors that influence students to embrace technology. This model will assist lecturers, faculty and student support structures to understand the underpinning factors that influence first-year students to embrace the technology tool, namely, the university’s LMS. Quantitative data collection and analysis were used in the case study, which was conducted with two groups of first-year students in management and information technology courses. Results show the significant factors that influence students’ attitudes positively towards the use of technology for learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blackboard; blended learning; learner adoption; Technology tools",""

To this aim, social influence (SI) and quality assurance (QA) were identified as the drivers of sustainable consumption leading to the formation of OPI. The input from the technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) has been incorporated to develop a model that explains the formation of OPI. Primary data were collected from 612 respondents and subjected to partial least square (PLS) analysis. The impact of SI and QA on OPI was found to be positively significant. Furthermore, the influence of perceived value (PV) as a mediator for the SI–OPI relationship has been discovered to be positively significant. This shows that as the PV increases, the influence of SI also increases. However, when the perceived risk (PR) was introduced as a mediator for the QA–OPI relationship, the influence of QA on OPI became insignificant. SI and QA impacts are the most important aspects that influence OPI according to this study, which is useful information for agricultural enterprises and online vendors. It is proposed that the SI and QA impacts might be exploited as a new tool to influence customers’ OPI for agricultural firms and online sellers. Therefore, managers must work to produce greater levels of PV in online purchases and reduce the PR in order to develop OPI for sustainable consumption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agricultural products; online purchase intentions; perceived risk; perceived value; quality assurance; social influence; sustainable consumption","perception; sustainability; World Wide Web"

Whereas various studies have shown children’s enthusiasm towards social robots in, for example, an educational context, little is known about children’s acceptance—or rejection—of domestic social robots. This paper aimed at filling this research gap by developing a model of children’s intention to adopt a social robot at home, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Relying on data from a survey among 570 children aged eight to nine, we found that, before having ever interacted with the robot in real life, 82% of the children were willing to adopt the robot at home. Children’s adoption intention was mainly predicted by hedonic attitudes and social norms, as well as by their general attitude towards robots, which was linked to adoption both directly and indirectly through hedonic attitudes and social norms. Our findings suggest that entertainment-related and normative considerations drive children’s intention to adopt a domestic social robot. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child–robot interaction; Human–machine interaction; Human–robot interaction; Social robotics; Technology acceptance","Agricultural robots; Educational robots; Robotics; Social robots; Child-robot interactions; Daily lives; Domestic environments; Educational context; Human machine interaction; Humans-robot interactions; Social norm; Social robotics; Technology acceptance; Digital storage"

Design/methodology/approach: The study comprises 218 responses of academicians associated with higher education in the Sultanate of Oman. Descriptive and factor analysis of the collected data are employed using SPSS-26. Further, using Amos-21, the fit and validity indices of the measurement model are computed. Various relationships of the UTAUT structural model along with moderation effects of gender and nationality are tested. Findings: The results suggest that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence significantly predict behavioral intention. In turn, behavioral intention and facilitating conditions also significantly predict the use behavior of academicians for videoconferencing in higher education. Finally, gender moderates two out of four UTAUT relations, but nationality does not moderate any of these relations. Originality/value: A lot of prior studies investigate several models to use technology-enabled pedagogy from educators' or students' perspectives. There are very limited studies that examine IoT-based learning tools within the UTAUT environment.

Most empirical investigations are limited to populations in the United States and Europe. Asian communities, particularly in Southeast Asia, which make for a large proportion of global car users, are underrepresented. To better understand the user acceptance toward in‐vehicle applications, additional factors need to be included in order to complement the existing constructs in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Hypotheses were developed and survey items were designed to validate the constructs in the research model. A total of 308 responses were received among Malaysians via convenience sampling and analyzed using linear and non‐linear regression analyses. Apart from that, a mediating effect analysis was also performed to assess the indirect effect a variable has on another associated variable. We extended the TAM by including personal characteristics, system characteristics, social influence and trust, which could influence users’ intention to use the in‐vehicle applications. We found that users from Malaysia are more likely to accept in‐vehicle applications when they have the information about the system and believe that the applications are reliable and give an advantage in their driving experience. Without addressing the user acceptance, the adoption of the applications may progress more slowly, with the additional unfortunate result that potentially avoidable crashes will continue to occur. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","driver assistance; in‐vehicle application; regression analysis; significance tests; statistical evaluation; technology acceptance","Acceptance tests; Automobile drivers; Automotive industry; Vehicles; Driver acceptance; Driver assistance; Empirical investigation; In-vehicle applications; Road environment; Significance test; Statistical evaluation; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Users' acceptance; Regression analysis"

Due to the huge amounts of recyclable resources generated every year and the low recycling rate, a new Internet recycling model with great potential to increase the recycling rate has developed rapidly in China. However, low participation from residents hinders the sustainable development of Internet recycling. Through this study, we aim to uncover potential avenues for improving Internet recycling behavior. The factors influencing Internet recycling from the perspective of new technologies have scarcely been investigated. Therefore, this study used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology theoretical framework to explore the factors influencing residents’ intentions and behavior toward Internet recycling. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 500 residents of Beijing, China, and empirical analysis was conducted using the structural equation model. The results indicated that social influence and performance expectancy significantly influence residents’ intentions to participate in Internet recycling, whereas effort expectancy and perceived risk do not.

However, few research studies have examined users' perspectives towards mobile AR games. To address this issue, the present study proposed a research model to better understand the factors determining and shaping users' behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games from a developing country environment. Based on a literature review, nine factors have been expected to determine and shape individuals' intention towards the acceptance and adoption of mobile AR games. Using WarpPLS software, the model was empirically tested with a survey of 240 non-adopter respondents collected via an online survey questionnaire. The model was found statistically robust in terms of measurement quality criteria: reliability, validity, multicollinearity, and goodness of fit. The analysis revealed that perceived ease-of-use, social norms, privacy, perceived enjoyment, perceived competition, perceived inspiration, perceived image, and perceived innovativeness affect users' behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games. However, the hypothesized moderating impact of perceived physical risk on the relationships connecting perceived ease-of-use, perceived enjoyment, perceived competition, and perceived inspiration with the intention to adopt was found to have little statistical significance. The result showed that perceived innovativeness was the strongest criterion to affect intention, and perceived ease-of-use was found to be the least important criterion in impacting users' intention. Interestingly, the model explains 76% of the variance in behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games.

We tested SCSAM by using structural equation modeling via 640 survey-respondents. The quantitative findings were supported by qualitative analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that personal innovativeness, social influence, quality of service (QoS) and perceived trust are the significant determinants of use intention. Interestingly cost has no significant effect and demographics do not contribute much on the acceptance of smart services.

Different factors influence early adopters of innovations and mass market representatives’ perceptions of the usefulness of social robots. The first aim of the study was to test how applicable the technology acceptance model 3 (TAM3) is in the context of social robots. Participants’ acceptance of social robotics in a workplace environment in the fuzzy front-end (FFE) innovation phase of a robot development project was examined. Based on the findings for the model, we developed a reduced version of the TAM3 that is more applicable for social robots. The second objective was to analyze how early adopters’ and mass market representatives’ acceptance of social robots differs. Quantitative research methods were used. For early adopters, result demonstrability has a significant influence on perceived usefulness of social robots, while for mass market representatives, perceived enjoyment has a more significant influence on perceived usefulness. The findings indicate that users’ innovation adoption style influences the factors that users consider important in the usefulness of social robots.

These cultured proteins are proposed as a potential solution to the detrimental effects industrial food farming and fishing have on the environment and animal welfare as they would allow people to continue consuming meat, fish, or dairy products while at the same time substantially reducing the burden for the planet. For most people, however, this technology is still unknown, and it is largely unclear how they position themselves toward it. This paper presents the results of a representative survey (N = 3,864) in three Nordic countries (Norway, Denmark, and Finland). After briefly introducing the technological background, respondents spontaneously assessed their general attitude toward cultured proteins, their willingness to try them, and the likelihood that changes in 24 features of cultured protein would improve the respondents' attitude toward cultured protein products. The results showed that people in the studied countries have a neutral to a slightly positive view of cultured protein products. More familiarity seems to improve acceptance. Males, younger people, and vegans/vegetarians are particularly positive. The anticipated attitude change profiles showed that meat-eating identity, social norms, environmental concern, and country yielded the clearest profile differences, whereas health identity, age, innovativeness, income, education, and gender have smaller effects. People on a vegan or vegetarian diet cared less about most of the positive and negative aspects of cultured proteins compared to meat-eaters, with the exception of environmental and ethical aspects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","attitude change; cultured meat; cultured proteins; psychological variables; willingness to try",""

The high growth of e-commerce has an impact on the sustainability of both the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environmental dimension. Indonesia is the country with the fastest-growing e-commerce but also has the second-largest plastic waste in the world. The synergy of sustainability for e-commerce is an interesting and awaited innovation. This is because sustainability has become the responsibility of all countries in the world. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical understanding of the context of sustainability in e-commerce separately focuses on a company perspective and the use of green products from a consumer perspective. It requires the involvement of e-commerce stakeholders as a whole to get comprehensive research results. The use of qualitative research methods with exploratory approaches is used in this study to reveal the concept of sustainability in e-commerce in Indonesia. Findings: This study found similarities in the topic of acceptance of sustainability in e-commerce with a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and habits. Changes to the variables were revealed due to changes in the e-commerce phase. The variable trust is in the introduction phase and builds trust in e-commerce. Currently, in Indonesia, the e-commerce phase is in a phase of growth and value formation. Habit creation and dependence is a requirement for value formation. Several new topics were proposed in this study, namely, awareness, security, logistics and user interface and user experience (UX). The establishment of an e-commerce identity through UX clearly shows its target market. The e-commerce phase and the topics involved in it can become a reference for e-commerce regulation-making in Indonesia. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to e-commerce in Indonesia with data processing limited to February 2020. Practical implications: The results of this study provide an overview of increasing the intention to use e-commerce through human acceptance and engineering dimensions. This research also reveals the stages of e-commerce in Indonesia that can be used as a reference for determining the right regulations for e-commerce and the trade-offs for sustainability. Originality/value: This study produces additional references to the intention to use technology by completing the UTAUT model. This study reveals changes in variables in perceived value that are interesting for further research along with technological developments and changes in people’s habits. Exploration carried out can add references to the application of sustainability in e-commerce, especially in developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-commerce; Information systems; Management information systems; Perceived value; Stage; Sustainability; UTAUT",""

Further, we extend traditional acceptance research by investigating not only usage, but payment intention and behavior. To this end, we refer to a representative survey of the German online population (N=4240) and estimate effects within the framework of a structural equation model. The results reveal that the traditional model is better suited to explain usage, but can also explain a substantial part of the variance in payment. Above all, price value, hedonic motivation and social influence appear to have the strongest positive effects on intent and behavior. Surprisingly, effort expectancy has a positive influence on paying intent. Managers who engage in content creation should highlight these aspects.

Recently, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected educational systems globally, leading them to embrace more innovative technological methods to meet academic demands while maintaining SLE principles. Mobile learning apps (MLA) refers to using the unique capabilities of mobile apps to engage and collaborate towards establishing robust online learning. However, the effectiveness of MLA depends on learners’ acceptance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that could affect MLA acceptance. In order to analyze the collected data from 415 Jordanian students among schools and universities, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. The empirical findings confirm that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significantly influenced by self-efficacy and perceived compatibility. Furthermore, perceived usefulness is significantly influenced by perceived convenience and perceived ease of use. Additionally, perceived enjoyment significantly influences the behavioral intention to use MLA. On the other hand, perceived compatibility has no significant influence on perceived enjoyment. Finally, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived compatibility have no significant effect on behavioral intention to use MLA. This study addresses a critical research gap in the distance learning acceptance literature by proposing an exhaustive model in the post-COVID-19 era that can help to improve students’ performance and outcomes in Jordanian schools and universities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","distance learning acceptance; innovation diffusion theory; mobile learning apps; social learning theory; structural equation modeling; sustainable learning; technology acceptance model","empirical analysis; ideology; learning; sustainability"

Acceptance of the implementation of technological solutions can be defined as the intention to use a technology or the effective use of it. Approaches based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) have been shown to have good predictive power for pre-implementation attitudes towards new technologies. Objective: To analyze the degree of acceptability of the use of new technologies for ageing in place and the factors associated with greater acceptance in people older than 64 years. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out. Sociodemographic, clinical and environmental variables, architectural barriers, social risk and quality of life, degree of autonomy, morbidity, and risk of falls were collected in a population sample over 64 years of age in a large region of western Spain. The degree of acceptance of the use of technologies was measured through a scale based on the TAM. Results: Of the 293 people included in the study, 36.2% exhibited a high acceptability of new technologies, 28.3% exhibited a medium acceptability, and 35.5% exhibited a low acceptability. Of all the factors, age, education level, and living alone were significantly associated with high acceptance in the adjusted analyses. Conclusions: Younger age, a higher education level, and living alone are factors associated with a greater degree of acceptance of the use of technologies for ageing in place. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ageing in place; Aging; Aging in place; Technological development","aging; autonomy; educational attainment; health risk; morbidity; quality of life; social behavior; technological development; technology adoption; age; architectural barrier; article; cross-sectional study; demography; education; educational status; human; human experiment; independent living; Spain; tertiary education; aged; technology; Aged; Aging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Independent Living; Quality of Life; Technology"

This study aims to understand the social acceptance of Photovoltaic (PV) water pumps in rural Pakistan and the farmers’ willingness to pay extra for green electricity. In 2021, cross-sectional data of 1200 farmers were collected from rural Punjab in Pakistan using a well-structured questionnaire. An extension of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to evaluate farmers’ intentions to install a PV water pump. The extended TPB model was compared with the model of the original TPB and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Moreover, a parametric econometric approach was used to estimate the determinants of farmers’ willingness to pay extra for green electricity. A comparison of models confirmed that the extended TPB model was performed better than its alternatives because it was associated with the lower value of Root-Mean Square Error of Approximation and the higher value of Comparative Fit Index. The path analysis results showed that the intention to install a PV water pump was positively associated with the coefficients of attitude towards environmental protection, subjective norms of sustainable behaviour, lack of electricity access, perceived behaviour control, and relative advantages. The cost of the PV water pump was negatively associated with the farmers’ intention to install it. The probability of ‘willingness to pay extra for green electricity’ was increased with education, household income, and lack of access to grid electricity but decreased with age and the cost of green energy technology. The findings highlighted that young, more educated, and wealthier farmers were more likely to accept green energy. The lack of financial resources, availability of fossil fuel alternatives, and lack of understanding of green energy technology were the main reasons for the stated unwillingness to pay extra for green energy. Unlikely in resource-rich countries, where people can afford costly green energy, thus far, the government must support the higher price of green energy technology with subsidies in resource-poor countries. Furthermore, providing awareness programs about using a PV water pump to rural populations may enhance public acceptance of the technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Controlled environmental agriculture; Green energy; Intention to install green technology; Solar energy; Theory of planned behaviour; Willingness to pay","Access control; Agriculture; Economic analysis; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Pumps; Regression analysis; Rural areas; Controled environmental agriculture; Green electricity; Green energy; Green energy technologies; Green technology; Intention to install green technology; Pakistan; Photovoltaic water pump; Theory of Planned Behavior; Willingness to pay; Solar energy; agricultural emission; alternative energy; econometrics; electricity; farmers attitude; fossil fuel; willingness to pay; Punjab [Pakistan]"

However, without the passengers’ acceptance, the potential to achieve these benefits will not be fulfilled. Therefore, this paper is focused on the factors that influence the acceptance of such vehicles and investigates how much the acceptance varies if different levels of supervision are provided. An online survey was conducted and factors like trust and experience were found to impact on the stated intention to use a self-driving bus. Additionally, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) factors, such as, effort expectancy, performance expectancy and social influence were found to impact user intentions. Interestingly, socio-demographic factors appeared to be determinants of the acceptance of public AVs only if an employee was no longer present in the bus. The study highlighted the importance of paying sufficient attention to qualitative psychological factors, next to classic instrumental attributes like travel time and costs, before and during the implementation of public AVs. As experience was found to be a relatively robust factor in explaining public AV acceptance, we expect that preferences towards autonomous public transportation evolve along with the transition from hypothetical scenarios to demonstration pilots, to their deployment in regular operations. We therefore recommend the extension of this research to revealed preference studies, thereby using the results of field studies and living labs. Policy makers and researchers should allow users to access public AVs in test phases, so that users can generate positive experiences. This is expected to reduce future efforts of encouraging the use of this new technology, before its implementation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous bus; Intention to use; Level of oversight; Survey; Trust; UTAUT",""

Overnight, social work intervention models provided in-person gave way to the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate direct practice in virtual environments (e-therapy). Social work’s slow acceptance of e-therapy prior to the pandemic resulted in a lack of training for many social work practitioners and MSW student interns, who were required to make rapid transitions to using and operating in online environments. It appears likely that e-therapy will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, so integrating education about effective e-therapy techniques into social work curricula seems like a logical next step. A social worker’s ability to establish the therapeutic alliance, which is at the heart of all helping relationships, will be central to this curricula. Understanding social work students’ perceptions of e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance can help shape the development of this new curriculum. Using internal student email, students at two Research I universities were invited to participate in a fully online anonymous survey dealing with attitudes towards e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance. Surveys were conducted in 2018 and April–May 2020. Survey questions were based on the only prior comprehensive study of student attitudes towards e-therapy (Finn in J Soc Work Educ 38(3), 403–419. https://doi.org/10.1080/10437797.2002.10779107, 2002). Study results indicate that students have e-therapy experience, believe that a practitioner can build a good therapeutic alliance, and think that some form of e-therapy will continue after the pandemic. These results confirm that further exploration about the inclusion of e-therapy education and its efficacy in social work curricula requires urgent attention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19; E-therapy; Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs); Social work practice; Therapeutic alliance",""

A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the world’s second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings: The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demand–driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications: The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications: Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value: The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE. This study examines diverse types of digital technologies in different circular business models in a homogeneous context of the fashion industry with heterogeneous firm types. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular business model; Circular economy; Digital innovation; Fashion industry; Sustainability",""

Technology, such as household smart meters measuring domestic water consumption, can play a role in demand management, yet a deeper understanding of public expectations and the practicalities of city-wide implementation is required. This article explores public perceptions of smart water meters that use Internet of Things (IoT) technology and machine learning to profile household water use “events” and anomalies. By leveraging insights from an online survey implemented in the UK (n = 558), this article explores factors influencing the likelihood of citizens choosing to have this type of meter installed along with potential societal barriers and opportunities. Nearly half of the participants said they would choose to have such a meter installed and logistic regression showed predictive variables were younger ages, being male, those with existing water meters and those with other smart devices. The likelihood of choosing this type of water meter was also associated with preferences to have control over data privacy, whether the meter would reduce water bills and whether it was provided free of charge. We locate these results within other contemporary experiences of smart meters and water grids in urban contexts to discuss practical challenges of using real-time environmental data for urban water governance. Policymakers and water resources planners should continue to monitor public perceptions, implement urban experiments and cost-benefit analyses to better interpret the wider benefits of such technology for behavioral and educational interventions within a more digitized and increasingly data-centric water grid. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","privacy; public acceptance; regression; smart water meter; urban water governance",""

In recent years, driven by the two wheels of financial market and information technology, the internet finance has experienced an extremely rapid development. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the performance expectation, effort expectation, social influence and purchase intention of UTAUT model, an empirical examination was conducted. Specifically, the authors made the user purchasing behavior as the dependent variable and added some new factors such as perceived risk, individual innovation and product cognition as the independent variables in the model, and they also added user gender and experience as regulated variables, so as to study the impact factors that affect the purchasing behavior. In addition, the authors also studied the impact of social network friend recommendations on consumers’ willingness to purchase. Findings: The research results showed that effort expectation, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, purchase intention, awareness and individual innovation have a positive effect on the behavior of buying financial products, whereas the perceived risk has a negative effect on the behavior of buying internet financial products. Additionally, in the context of social networking, social network friend recommendations have a positive impact on consumers’ willingness to purchase. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on the integrated technology acceptance model, which makes the user purchasing behavior as the dependent variable and adds some new factors such as perceived risk, individual innovation and product cognition as the independent variables. However, the research on recommendation between social network friends is not deep enough, so further improvement is needed. Practical implications: This study can enrich the existing theories on the interpretation of the intention of using internet financial products, help internet financial enterprises understand user behavior and demands better, and improve service quality and customer satisfaction.

Large classes of university students and numerous professionals can learn from best case practices as on-the-job training. However, the job is not often available, the best case practices are not accessible to everyone, and the construction field is hazardous, so it may not be safe for a large group of students to attend operating construction sites. The large size of classes and, currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is also hindering the application of authentic and case-based training. This paper presents the process of developing and implementing innovative virtual tour (VT) modules to support on-the-job training needs where the teaching approach is the case-based storytelling scenario. The paper shows how the VTs were utilized for students’ learning, and their behavior was examined to see if it could support the development of a novel virtual teaching acceptance model (VTAM) as a theoretical framework for measuring educational technology adoption. VTAM comprises an amalgamation of technology attributes and learning factors, including perceived usefulness, engagement, situated learning, immersion, social presence, perceived utility, information-rich sources, and perceived satisfaction. VTAM was validated by conducting a longitudinal three-year survey with the participation of 339 VT users and an interview of 31 users to triangulate the quantitative analysis outcomes. The survey data was analyzed by using structural equation modeling (SEM) and parametric multi-group analysis (PMGA), and the interview transcriptions were analyzed using coding techniques. The outcome shows that VTAM, accompanied by situated learning, immersion, and social presence, has the strongest impact on engagement which positively affects students' satisfaction. VTAM helps to understand the critical factors affecting the usefulness of immersive technologies in education. The outcome is crucial to virtual system developers and online education designers for understanding students’ behavior in implementing virtual technologies successfully. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","360-Degree modules; Immersive environment; Parametric multi-group analysis; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; User behavior; Virtual reality","Behavioral research; E-learning; Education computing; Educational technology; Learning systems; Metals; Surveys; Virtual reality; 360-degree module; Acceptance models; Group analysis; Immersive environment; Multi-group; Parametric multi-group analyse; Structural equation models; Technology acceptance model; User behaviors; Virtual teaching; Students; behavioral response; learning; numerical model; teaching; technology adoption; training; virtual reality"

Thailand, among many countries, has established NCORS to observe and process the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to improve the accuracy of positional data that serve many spatially related activities of government agencies. Optimising the use of NCORS data in other potential sectors is the next challenge to tackle. The research was conducted in three phases: 1) formulating an NCORS data ecosystem concept, 2) applying the developed concept to identify the gaps of NCORS in Thailand, and 3) examining the policies to address the identified gaps. In phase one, an NCORS data ecosystem was conceptualised to explain the nature of NCORS data and the environment in which the NCORS data are created, processed, and used. The NCORS data ecosystem concept was developed by synthesising previous conceptualisations linking data and ecosystems and elaborating on existing literature on NCORS, backed up by experts’ insights and practical experiences gathered during the research. Eventually, an NCORS data ecosystem was defined as “a system where technical and institutional elements at the national level coexist and collectively interact to facilitate the flow of different NCORS data forms from providers to users”. Since NCORS data are spatial data by their properties and functions, this research applied a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) concept to describe the elements of the NCORS data ecosystem. From here, two types of elements were identified: “central elements” and “surrounding elements”. The central elements include an NCORS data chain and an NCORS network. The NCORS data chain contains different data forms, such as GNSS observation data, achieve data, and correction data. The NCORS data chain can be seen in various positioning services, such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Differential-GNSS (DGNSS), and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The surrounding elements are people, standards, policies, institutional frameworks, financial resources, and technology. These surrounding elements collectively interact to facilitate the flow of NCORS data and the functionality of the NCORS network. The research categorised the collective interactions into three mechanisms: NCORS data governance, NCORS data provision, and NCORS data use. NCORS data governance consists of the organisational interactions of policymakers, NCORS providers, authorities, and stakeholders involved in the NCORS data ecosystem. The NCORS data governance directs NCORS data provision, which aims to make NCORS data available. While much research has provided knowledge to explain NCORS data governance and provision, little knowledge is available to explain NCORS data use. This research, therefore, combined the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to fill the knowledge gap in NCORS data use. Through DOI theory, it was possible to regard NCORS data use as a user-driven mechanism where users (individuals or entities) use the NCORS data and generate the diffusion of the NCORS data use within and across societal systems. The characteristics of NCORS data users were notably based upon demography, perception about the use, communication behaviours and other conditions involving the use. Through TAM, it was possible to get a deeper understanding of the perception about the use. The performance of NCORS data use was defined in two levels: basic use—the use within original users or purposes and optimal use—the use that expands to other users or purposes. Ultimately, to operationalise the knowledge of an NCORS data ecosystem concept, such a concept was translated into a Subsystem Diagram (SSD), a tool to understand and assess an NCORS data ecosystem. The SSD represents an innovative way to illustrate the relationships and performance of the mechanisms in the NCORS data ecosystem. Such an illustration enables the research to evaluate the NCORS data ecosystems and compare them to others in the next phase. Phase two of the research applied the developed NCORS data ecosystem concept with a multi-case study approach to compare Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Thailand. The first three countries were experienced and successful in optimising NCORS data use. The research findings indicate that, in Thailand, providing NCORS data as open data does not assure optimal NCORS data use. To get a deeper understanding of the situation, a specific user group sector was chosen for investigation – rice farming – due to its socio-economic role in Thailand and the potential of the activity in using NCORS data. The research applied a survey to investigate the farmers’ needs, practices, and attitudes toward NCORS technology. The result showed that 1) most farmers were willing to use NCORS technology, but NCORS technology was not available in the market for them to purchase 2) around half of the respondents have knowledge of NCORS, and 3) the annual data cost between 1-1,000 THB (30 EURO) is acceptable for most respondents. The investigation illustrated that next to the NCORS data availability and the users’ demand, NCORS data use also requires facilitating conditions, such as the availability of NCORS technology and relevant NCORS knowledge. This research identified three areas of improvement in encouraging NCORS data use: the availability of NCORS technology, the relevant knowledge involving NCORS data, and the cost of NCORS data use. In phase three, related to the policy venue, the research adopted the System Dynamics (SD) methodology to examine the outcomes of policies addressing the three identified areas of improvement. The three policies aim to trigger, accelerate, and enlarge the NCORS data use. The first policy seeks to trigger diffusion by making NCORS technology readily available. The availability of NCORS technology in machinery (for example, tractors/ drones) that farmers already use will allow them to use NCORS data. The availability of NCORS technology is envisaged to trigger the adoption and diffusion of NCORS data use. The second policy aims to accelerate the diffusion of NCORS data use by addressing the knowledge about NCORS data availability and NCORS technology. Farmers are the primary target of the knowledge campaign. In parallel, change agents and opinion leaders, who have a crucial role in delivering/fostering the knowledge to/of farmers, need to be provided with the knowledge. Change agents include machine companies and agricultural department staff. The opinion leaders or influencers are such as successful farmers, village sages, and academics. These people significantly contribute to the spread of technology. The third policy is to enlarge the potential users through Open Data NCORS (OD-NCORS). Although the annual NCORS data cost is acceptable for most farmers, the OD policy should be applied to NCORS to maximise the volume of potential users. These three policies should be implemented in combination with each other. More efforts are needed to facilitate conditions that empower potential users. The critical driving forces, such as political and public support and relations with machine companies, are the strategic areas to establish. Therefore, it is the role of NCORS data governance to approach such actors to provide facilitating conditions. Nevertheless, the stakeholders must keep in mind that all policies and efforts take time to exhibit the expected result. In addition to serving the research’s aim, this research established three features of scientific relevance. First, the formulated knowledge of an NCORS data ecosystem significantly contributes to a comprehensive knowledge of generic data ecosystem concepts. The key contribution of this research is the comprehensive understanding of NCORS data use. Even though much research has grown in the light of user perspective, the research’s views stem from the repeated points—data use as a goal of data provision. This research expressed that data use is an activity that occurs in individual and societal systems. This attempt can be a paradigm shift from a theoretical and practical perspective in addressing the use of NCORS and other data. Understanding the NCORS data use broadens the understanding of the NCORS data ecosystem concept. This research turned the knowledge into an SSD, a novel way to illustrate the relations and overview of the NCORS data ecosystem’s mechanics. Such illustration enables stakeholders to evaluate the NCORS data ecosystems and compare them. Second, from the view that data use is a mechanism, this research proposes the components of user characteristics by synthesising DOI and TAM knowledge. The user characteristics in this research describe users based on their actions in using and spreading the information about the use. The description enhances users as actors in a data ecosystem. Although further investigations are needed to specify users in different types of data or the societal systems they belong to, the user characteristics in the present research are sufficient to serve the research aim and initiate the venue for data policy research. Third, developing a diffusion model of NCORS data use added new aspects to the general DOI model. Two modifications were made to allow the model to capture the situation in Thailand. First, a modification was to model the incomplete diffusion structures, lacking technology in the case of Thailand. Second, this research introduced a link of information transfer to the original diffusion model. Such modifications contribute to the synthesis of knowledge within the general diffusion model. Further research is encouraged to apply the concept of the NCORS data ecosystem developed in this research to explore NCORS in other contexts and for other data types. The application may provide insights to improve the NCORS and general data ecosystem concepts. For the NCORS in Thailand, further research should look into how to better understand and improve the facilitating conditions of data use to ensure the success of open NCORS data. Finally, future research into the alignment between NCORS and CCORS for the best interest of citizens will be vital since there is a possibility of the CCORS network establishment in Thailand. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",""

Most of these debates are rooted in different risk perceptions of various societal stakeholders. Despite growing studies on GM foods’ knowledge, attitude, or behaviour, few have documented the risk perception models to assess stakeholders’ risk perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a model to explain the social risk perception of GM foods. To this end, current risk perception theories and models were critically reviewed, then an attempt was made to develop an integrated and more comprehensive model called the “Comprehensive Social Risk Perception Model” (CSRPM). Addressing the theoretical and methodological weakness of conventional models, CSRPM could be a complementary model to more effectively study the social risk perception of GM foods in developed and developing countries. Furthermore, CSRPM can also be used in ex-ante and ex-post risk assessments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agricultural development; agricultural extension; consumer acceptance; consumer rights, perceived benefits; food label information; GM foods; GM technology; risk assessment models; safe food; social risk perception",""

The understanding of the determinants and reasons accounting for the acceptance of social commerce among the people is critical to practitioners and scholars alike to properly implement social media strategies to drive up social commerce purchases. This study thus examined the intention to purchase in social commerce among Chinese citizens based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Exchange Theory (SET). The data (632 valid responses) generated through a research questionnaire was analyzed by the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) aided by AMOS statistical software. The results indicate that trusting beliefs such as trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, and the benevolence of the seller were significant predictors of the intention to engage in social commerce purchase intention. However, the competency of the seller was not a significant determinant of the intention to purchase in social commerce. Other results showed that the consumer experience in social commerce was significant in predicting the trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, the competency of the seller, and the benevolence of the seller in social commerce interaction. The validations of the significant impact of consumer experience on the four-trusting belief factors (trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, competency of the seller, and benevolence of the seller) are among the major contributions of this study to the e-commerce and social commerce literature.

The impact recorded on students’ experience has been reliant on various factors. Some of these factors are cultural diversity, technical abilities, level of organisational support, language difficulties, educational background, learning environment, and instructional design, among others. In this study, the acceptance and use of technology by international MBA students have been reassessed in the blended learning environment. The motivation for the selection of the cohort of international MBA students as a sample was to enable the inclusion of diversity as one of the focal points of the study. A two-cycle model of action research was adopted to reassess the use of technology and compare the attainment of learning outcomes between the blended and traditional learning approaches. Moreover, multiple regressions were employed using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to test the significance of each variable collected from the survey on the students’ learning experience and engagement. Our results have suggested that students’ engagement is determined by positive learning experience without any bias toward traditional or blended learning approach. Students’ age group was found to be relevant in the determination of behavioural intention, social influence, effort expectancy, performance expectancy and facilitating conditions towards the effective use of technology and blended learning.

Understanding the factors that influence mobile commerce and mobile payments in their context will aid in promoting those services. Background The study investigates the factors that influence public servants’ mobile commerce and mobile payments in Ghana. Hence, it provides some understanding of the various aspects of mobile commerce and mobile payments adoption, such as acceptance, use, and eventual adoption into the user’s daily life, and how that affects their behaviour. Methodology The research was conducted by surveying the factors influencing public servants’ adoption of mobile commerce and payments in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to put the research model to the test to measure the constructs and their relationships. Contribution The study confirmed previous findings and created a new conceptual model for mobile commerce and mobile payment adoption and usage in the Ghanaian context. Findings The variables of performance expectancy, trust, and facilitating conditions have a significant positive influence on behavioural intention. The factors of effort expectation and social influence have a significant negative impact. Price value and perceived reliability are latent variables that do not affect behavioural intention. Behavioural intention and facilitating conditions significantly influence the actual use behaviour of mobile commerce and mobile payment users. Recommendations Mobile commerce is emerging as a new mode of transactions, with firms for Practitioners providing enabling platforms for users. Mobile commerce could become the most acceptable application for the next generation of mobile platform applications. This study offers insights into the fluidity of the mobile environment, with implications that spell out what will be effective mobile commerce services that will continue to be relevant. Mobile applications are attractive to people because they provide a better user experience. These mobile applications have been optimised to provide a fast, easy and delightful experience. Mobile commerce and mobile payment service providers can attract and retain more users if attention is paid to performance expectancy, trust, and facilitating conditions since they influence individuals’ decisions to adopt. Mobile technology is almost ubiquitous, influencing both online sales and in-store sales. With the right mobile commerce platform and features, businesses can expect to increase in-store and online sales, catering to a more extensive clientele. Mobile devices are the primary means that most customers use to look up information about products they see in stores, such as product reviews and pricing options. This study indicates that mobile commerce service providers can achieve a more extensive customer base by promoting performance expectancy, trust, and behavioural intentions. Recommendations Despite the numerous studies in the mobile commerce literature, few have used for Researchers integrated models of perceived reliability, trust, and price value or methods to evaluate these factors in the emerging mobile commerce industry. Also, it combines mobile commerce and mobile payments, which very few that we know of have done. Impact on Society Ghana is already in a cash-lite economy. Thus, the study is appropriate with the result of trust being a significant factor. It implies that people will begin using mobile commerce and mobile payments with a bit of drive to bring about this drive quickly. Future Research Future research could further test the adapted model with moderating factors of age, gender, and education to delve deeper into the complexities of mobile commerce and mobile payments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption; behavioural intention; Ghanaian public servants; mobile commerce; trust","Developing countries; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile computing; Sales; Surveys; Adoption; Behavioral intention; Facilitating conditions; Ghanaian public servant; Mobile commerce services; Mobile payment; Performance; Price values; Public servants; Trust; Mobile commerce"

The A-frame framework and JavaScript (JS) language are used to complete the construction of the virtual supermarket environment and initially design the basic framework of task-based courseware for Chinese language teaching based on virtual reality technology. Experts were invited to conduct two rounds of prestudy on the index system and determine the evaluation indexes. The international students in the junior Chinese class of X University were randomly selected as the research subjects and divided into experimental and control groups for the experimental intervention teaching. The content and form of classroom teaching were the same for both groups, and they were asked to review and consolidate the grammar points learned in class after class. The only intervention was that the experimental group was required to conduct microlearning after class with the classroom grammar points, while the control group was not required to do the same form of review after class. In addition, the students in the experimental group were followed up as a case study, and their attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge proficiency in the microlearning were recorded in detail to assess the students' acceptance and satisfaction of the microlearning from the perspective of qualitative analysis. It was found that the microlessons for teaching and learning Chinese as a foreign language can stimulate learners' interest in learning, achieve good interactive effects, and contribute to the improvement of learners' performance. This paper combines virtual reality technology, fully explores the role that immersive VR technology can play in providing cultural scenarios in the target language, and maximizes the use of existing technological vehicles and resources for Chinese teaching application design, to solve the challenges of poor interactivity in online teaching and the lack of socio-cultural contexts that have long existed in overseas Chinese teaching. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Teaching; Virtual reality; Chinese educations; Chinese language; Control groups; Course design; Course development; Design and Development; Experimental groups; Micro-learning; Research and analysis; Virtual reality technology; Students; China; controlled study; education; human; language; learning; psychology; randomized controlled trial; student; university; Education, Distance; Humans; Language; Learning; Universities"

While many studies are conducted to address this issue, they mainly focus on improving the user interface design, rarely considering psychological aspects of the elderly. We aim to investigate how to help the elderly better accept kiosk technology by understanding their psychological characteristics. Methods We started with an understanding of the kiosk industry and the psychological problems experienced by the elderly. Then, we identified from the literature several factors affecting technology acceptance and integrate them into the user experience (UX) design process. Through observations and interviews with the elderly, psychological problems experienced by the elderly were identified and analyzed. Additional interviews with educators were conducted to further understand the factors and educational methods that affect the elderly’s acceptance of kiosks, which were followed by an on-site observation of kiosk education. Results Most of the elderly remained in the expected and introduction stages due to unfamiliar kiosk culture, social pressure, and low self-efficacy. These barriers can be overcome by providing supporters, motivating the elderly, improving store environment and line-up experience, and accumulating success experiences. We also found that repetitive use should be induced and socially supported so that the elderly can accept, habituate, and integrate technology. Conclusions We propose a new way to improve the kiosk UX that focuses on the technology acceptance psychology of the elderly against previous studies that focus on improving the user interface. We expect that our study results can serve as a basis for future studies on systemic design solutions for improved Kiosk UX. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elderly; Kiosk; Technology acceptance; Ux design",""

Pervasive sensing and monitoring of workers' health-, behavioural-, emotional and cognitive status to support their health and workability enable the creation of adaptive work environments and the provision of personalised interventions. However, this technology also introduces new challenges that go beyond user acceptance and privacy concerns. Based on a conceptual investigation and lessons learnt within the SmartWork project (H2020-826343), this paper outlines opportunities and ethical challenges of pervasive sensing technology in the work environment that aims to support active and healthy ageing for office workers in a holistic way, including their values and preferences. Only by identifying those challenges, implicated values and value tensions is it possible to convert them into design opportunities and find innovative ways to address identified tensions. The article outlines steps taken within the project and closes with a reflection on the limits of technological responses to societal problems and the need for regulations and changes on a societal level. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital health; Ethical challenges; Healthy ageing; Human values; Personalised interventions; Smart work environment",""

For this, grey scientific data were used, i.e., data and reports from non‐university agencies reflecting research commissioned by civil society NGOs and commercial enterprises. The aim was to find perspectives for action (practical “rules of thumb”) to increase the impact of sustainable housing on CO<inf>2</inf> reduction and facilitate the implementation of the Dutch national sustainability program. First, a conceptual framework and research model were created to generate the relevant research questions for the sustainable construction sector. An innovative research approach was used where data from academic non‐university researchers were enriched by university academic researchers. Experiences with the methodology used are: (a) It implicitly places the many factors that influence sustainable resident behaviour in context; and (b) it makes clear that data from such research can complement university research with useful data from practice, data that are scientifically difficult to use because they are mostly derived from stand‐alone case studies. The perspectives for action that were generated are: (a) Sustainable technologies must add new useful functionalities for acceptance; (b) sustainable supply must be tailor‐made because households differ and tenants behave differently from homeowners; (c) decision‐making about sustainable investments is not only based on financial factors; (d) residents are reluctant to become involved, so it is important that (e) the people representing contractors should be reliable; and (f) people want personalised plans and on‐time delivery. Finally, the collected reports turned out to be focused on practice and therefore provided less theoretical information about the rebound effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CO2 reduction; community of knowledge; energy transition; resident behaviour; sustainable housing",""

Retrofitting existing buildings with smart and sustainable technologies shows the potential in reducing the environmental impacts of the housing sector and improving the quality of life for residents. However, the efficiency of these means depends on their individual and societal acceptance. This calls for the need to incorporate social practice theories into the discussion of smart cities and technology adoption. This study aims to understand how smart retrofit intervention in an extensive pioneering smart city project in Estonia is perceived among the residents with different dispositions towards the environment and technology in an early phase of the intervention. We interviewed the residents of 18 Soviet‐era apartment buildings which underwent a complete retrofit into nearly zero‐energy buildings equipped with smart technologies. The results showed that pro‐technology residents expressed high interest and trust towards smart retrofit intervention, while residents with environmentally inclined dispositions conveyed more critical arguments. This indicates that individuals’ underlying dispositions may result in different social practices and that a diverse set of engagement approaches are crucial for the success and social acceptance of large‐scale pioneering projects in the housing sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","environmental sustainability; nearly zero‐energy renovation; smart city; smart retrofit intervention; technology adoption",""

Accordingly, this study defines a model based on the unified theory of acceptance and technology 2 (UTAUT2) to examine the relationship between facilitating conditions and other variables towards intention formation for Google Classroom usage. Based on a mixed method using the explanatory sequential design, survey data from 163 students were initially analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling followed by a qualitative approach based on open-ended questions for thematic analysis. Results from the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach validated the hypothesised model confirming the significant predictive relationship of facilitating conditions with effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit and social influence but had an insignificant relationship with behavioural intention. Furthermore, hedonic motivation and habit were the main predictors of behavioural intention by masking the role of facilitating conditions. Subsequently, the qualitative outcome indicated that habit and perceived control of using Google applications influence hedonic motivation.

Human senses have evolved to recognise sensory cues. Beyond our perception, they play an integral role in our emotional processing, learning, and interpretation. They are what help us to sculpt our everyday experiences and can be triggered by aesthetics to form the foundations of our interactions with each other and our surroundings. In terms of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots have the possibility to interact with both people and environments given their senses. They can offer the attributes of human characteristics, which in turn can make the interchange with technology a more appealing and admissible experience. However, for many reasons, people still do not seem to trust and accept robots. Trust is expressed as a person's ability to accept the potential risks associated with participating alongside an entity such as a robot. Whilst trust is an important factor in building relationships with robots, the presence of uncertainties can add an additional dimension to the decision to trust a robot. In order to begin to understand how to build trust with robots and reverse the negative ideology, this paper examines the influences of aesthetic design techniques on the human ability to trust robots. Method. This paper explores the potential that robots have unique opportunities to improve their facilities for empathy, emotion, and social awareness beyond their more cognitive functionalities. Through conducting an online questionnaire distributed globally, we explored participants ability and acceptance in trusting the Canbot U03 robot. Participants were presented with a range of visual questions which manipulated the robot's facial screen and asked whether or not they would trust the robot. A selection of questions aimed at putting participants in situations where they were required to establish whether or not to trust a robot's responses based solely on the visual appearance. We accomplished this by manipulating different design elements of the robots facial and chest screens, which influenced the human-robot interaction. Results. We found that certain facial aesthetics seem to be more trustworthy than others, such as a cartoon face versus a human face, and that certain visual variables (i.e., blur) afforded uncertainty more than others. Consequentially, this paper reports that participant's uncertainties of the visualisations greatly influenced their willingness to accept and trust the robot. The results of introducing certain anthropomorphic characteristics emphasised the participants embrace of the uncanny valley theory, where pushing the degree of human likeness introduced a thin line between participants accepting robots and not. By understanding what manipulation of design elements created the aesthetic effect that triggered the affective processes, this paper further enriches our knowledge of how we might design for certain emotions, feelings, and ultimately more socially acceptable and trusting robotic experiences © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aesthetics; Risk; Robot; Trust","Behavioral research; Machine design; Man machine systems; Robotics; Design elements; Esthetic; Human sense; Humans-robot interactions; Interaction robot; Potential risks; Robot; Sensory cues; Trust; Uncertainty; Human robot interaction"

However, fleet operator perspectives have thus far received limited attention, leaving a key knowledge gap. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring HDV fleet operator decisions about alternative fuel adoption using both existing literature and new empirical data. To this end, we first develop an initial theoretical framework of AFV fleet adoption behavior in organizations based upon existing theories and literature. We then empirically improve the framework by investigating 20 organizations in California via in-depth qualitative interviews and project reports. A total of 29 adoption and 42 non-adoption cases were probed across various alternative fuel technologies, including natural gas, propane, electricity, hydrogen, biodiesel, and renewable diesel options. Content analysis of the qualitative data yielded 38 motivators or barriers related to AFV adoption, encompassing perceived technological characteristics, organization characteristics, and external environmental influences. The study results contribute theoretically and empirically to a better understanding of the demand-side aspects of AFV adoption by HDV fleet operators, particularly in California and in the other US states that follow California's environmental policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative fuel; Fleet; Heavy-duty vehicle; Innovation non-adoption decision; Organizational adoption; Technology acceptance","Environmental protection; Fleet operations; Vehicles; Adoption decision; Alternative fuel vehicles; California; Fleet; Fleet operators; Heavy duty vehicles; Innovation non-adoption decision; Organizational adoptions; Technology acceptance; Vehicle fleets; Alternative fuels; alternative fuel; innovation; organization; technology adoption; transport vehicle; United States"

To analyse user acceptance of AI-powered AVs, we need to understand the related psychological, social and cognitive factors. To do so, we established a conceptual model based on the technology acceptance literature and considered how performance and effort expectancy, social recognition, hedonism technology security and privacy concerns influence both technology trust and user well-being as mediators that subsequently influence the behavioural intention of the use of AI-powered AVs.

Literature has called for a better understanding of psychological factors encouraging people to carpool however current research does not provide an in-depth psychological understanding of carpooling behaviour. This paper provides a review of psychological factors motivating drivers and passengers to carpool and identifies psychological theories appropriate for carpooling research. The Theory of Planned Behaviour and Norm-Activation Model were used as a priori theoretical frameworks to undertake a systematic literature review to identify important factors and relevant theories. Eighteen psychological factors were identified and classified as either common for drivers and passengers or specific to each group. In addition to the a priori frameworks, Consumer Perceived Value, Social Capital, and Technology Acceptance Model are considered the most appropriate for carpooling research. A conceptual framework and six research propositions were developed. Further, eight additional directions for future research were suggested including employing a variety of data collection methods to ensure rigour; collecting more data from non-Western countries for contextual veracity; exploring and testing psychological factors more deeply; and investigating the impact of COVID-19 on carpooling decisions. This paper contributes to theory through the development of the conceptual framework, identifying research propositions and providing additional research directions. The identified factors can be considered by researchers, matching agencies, and policy-makers to better promote carpooling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carpooling; Carpooling platform; Psychological factors; Psychological theory; Role preferences; Systematic literature review",""

We study the experiences of Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, to find out whether the forest-based bioenergy chains developed in the four countries have led to unsustainable outcomes and how the countries manage the sustainability risks. Data were collected from a diversity of sources including interviews, statistical databases, the scientific literature, government planning documents and legislation. Results: Sustainability risks of deforestation, degradation of forests, reduced carbon pools in forests, expensive biopower and heat, resource competition, and lack of acceptance at the local level are considered. The experience of the four countries shows that the sustainability risks can to a high degree be managed with voluntary measures without resorting to prescriptive measures. It is possible to add to the carbon pools of forests along with higher harvest volumes if the risks are well managed. There is, however, a marginal trade-off between harvest volume and carbon pools. Economic sustainability risks may be more challenging than ecological risks because the competitiveness order of renewable energy technologies has been reversed in the last decade. The risk of resource competition harming other sectors in the economy was found to be small and manageable but requires continuous monitoring. Local communities acting as bioenergy communities have been agents of change behind the most expansive bioenergy chains. A fear of non-local actors reaping the economic gains involved in bioenergy chains was found to be one of the risks to the trust and acceptance necessary for local communities to act as bioenergy communities. Conclusions: The Nordic experience shows that it has been possible to manage the sustainability risks examined in this paper to an extent avoiding unsustainable outcomes. Sustainability risks have been managed by developing an institutional framework involving laws, regulations, standards and community commitments. Particularly on the local level, bioenergy chains should be developed with stakeholder involvement in development and use, in order to safeguard the legitimacy of bioenergy development and reconcile tensions between the global quest for a climate neutral economy and the local quest for an economically viable community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioenergy; Nordic countries; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sustainability","Carbon; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Lakes; Laws and legislation; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Continuous monitoring; Economic sustainability; Institutional framework; Renewable energy technologies; Resource competitions; Scientific literature; Stakeholder involvement; Statistical database; Risk management; alternative energy; bioenergy; competitiveness; database; institutional framework; risk assessment; stakeholder; sustainability; trade-off; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Scandinavia; Sweden"

Social problems can be discussed in these networks, receiving the aid from these devices, in order to unite community members in a network that is strengthened for common goals, transforming the local reality. The motivation for this work lies in the fact that lack of security is one of the problems that have most afflicted Brazilians in recent years. From this reality, the main objective of this study was the development of a usability analysis model suitable for smartphone applications and that allows identifying of the viability of using a collaborative security application in the social context of a city of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The objective was designed to investigate how the different dimensions inherent to the social context interfere with the acceptance of technological resources, specifically, of a smartphone application in a community. Data collection was performed by applying two questionnaires to 22 participants living in the municipality (eight men and 14 women), one being a demographic survey and the other to evaluate usability focusing on users’ perception of the use of the application. The application usage scenario is family safety facing the challenges of mitigating public security issues. The analysis of the results was based on the reinterpretation of usability from the perspective of the Theory of Innovation Diffusion and the Recursive Model of Access to Technology. In order to validate the reliability of the instrument used to collect the data regarding the usability of the application, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was applied. The result indicates that the instrument used was concise and efficient. The study enabled conclusions pointing that this type of interpretation allows us to glimpse at horizons that go beyond explicit aspects of usability, helping to understand environmental and social factors intrinsic to the context of technological diffusion in a developing society. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access to technology; Innovation diffusion; Social factors; Usability","Data acquisition; Smartphones; Surveys; Usability engineering; Alpha coefficients; Collaborative securities; Innovation diffusion; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Smart-phone applications; Technological resources; Usability analysis; Usability evaluation; Mobile security"

The paper analyses the antecedents that lead to the use of innovative vehicles. Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is adopted and extended by including further constructs, such as environmental aspects and inhibitors. Design/methodology/approach: The advent of smart technologies and the internet of things has given rise to several contributions that look at consumers’ intention towards innovation adoption in the automotive industry. Furthermore, this study rises from the growing interest that sustainable mobility achieved. Based on the previous technology acceptance models and particularly TPB, this paper develops a structured questionnaire. After a pilot survey, the final questionnaire was administered online through email and social media in the Italian context. Structural equation modelling technique has been used for analysing data and testing the conceptual model. Findings: The number of questionnaires filled out was 310, with a sample composed of young adults, characterised by different addiction levels towards technology. The results explain the drivers that lead to accept and adopt high-tech automated vehicles. This topic is still under investigation and offers potential research opportunities, considering the evolution of the market and the consumers’ habits and needs. Future research studies in this area should focus on generalising the present findings in other countries. Moreover, once this technology starts to be adopted, other constructs could be discovered, investigated and included in the model. Originality/value: Mobility has raised a growing interest with the fast increasing demand for sustainability and growth of innovative solutions embedded in mobility. This research explores the TPB model’s application and the relation between its constructs, environmental aspects, inhibitors and intention to adopt automated vehicles. On this strength, it is possible to identify each construct’s relevance for obtaining social consensus on the market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated vehicles; Environment; High-tech car; Innovation; Intention; Mobility; Sustainability",""

The purpose of this paper is to identify what affects users’ intention to reuse and whether they perceive any difference between the two. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed based on computer-mediated communication (CMC) and interpersonal communication theories. Data were collected online from four different continents (North America, Europe, Asia and Australia). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research model. Findings: The findings mainly reveal that media richness and social presence positively influence trust and reuse intention through task attraction and social attraction; IM users reported significantly higher scores in terms of communication experience, perceived attractiveness of the conversational agent, and trust than chatbot users; users’ trust in the conversational agents is mainly determined by perceived task attraction. Research limitations/implications: Customers’ evaluation of the communication environment is positively related to their perceived competence of the conversational agent which ultimately affect their intention to reuse chatbot/IM. The findings reveal determinants of chatbot/IM adoption which have rarely been mentioned by previous work. Practical implications: Practitioners should note that consumers in general still prefer to interact with human conversational agents. Practitioners should contemplate how to combine chatbot and human resources effectively to deliver the best customer service.

Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review about this topic, where 75 reviewed studies were analyzed according to the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) components. Findings highlighted that: (1) from the subject component, future research should involve more stakeholders, like parents and policymakers, when discussing tolerance education; (2) from the object component, tolerance education should not only focus on the physical environment, but also on the virtual environment; (3) from the tools component, limited digital tools and technology have been used to promote tolerance education; (4) from the community component, more investigation of tolerance education should be outside of school contexts; (5) from the rules component, more ICT training should be provided. The use of big data and learning analytics could be one of the potential methods to assess students in tolerance education; (6) from the labor division component, school family interaction role is very important to manage risks and diversities through tolerance education; and (7) from the outcomes component, tolerance education studies should go beyond simply investigating the awareness and attitudes of learners, and investigate, for instance, the behavioral changes of learners.

The usage of technology for instructional purposes raises the question of whether learning that happens in an online environment is as effective as traditional classroom models. Within this context, this study explores the psychological well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic, using an online cross-sectional survey. Data were collected from 246 university students currently studying at a private university in India. Hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation modelling were used to study the mediating effects between communication apprehension, perceived learning, and psychological well-being under the moderating effects of intention to use social media and psychological stress. Results show that higher intentions to use social media alleviated the negative effects of communication apprehension on perceived learning. Interestingly, it was also found that perceived learning had a significant positive relationship with psychological well-being when students experienced higher levels of psychological stress (eustress). Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the transactional theory of stress and coping, we attempt to integrate the findings related to these theories, which can be considered distinct to previous studies.

In this article, we integrated the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT 2) as well as Health Belief Model and set up a mask acceptance model. We used a questionnaire survey and received 337 valid questionnaires. The results indicate that social influence, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived hedonic benefit (appearance enhancement), and a perceived barrier (hindrance to communication) exert significant influences on the willingness to wear masks. Meanwhile, social influence plays an intermediary role between interdependent self-construal and intention to wear a mask.

Initial pre-service teacher education is critical in reducing the attitude-behaviour divide supporting technology acceptability, acceptance and use. Acceptance of interaction between human and robot is more complicated than human-computer interaction acceptance. Social robots are radical innovations, harder for potential users to accept in human social spaces than are incremental innovations. In 2019, a survey using a convenience sample of 121 first-year students was conducted to examine pre-service teachers' beliefs about social robot educational technology. It examined the following factors derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology adopted for social robots in education: Perceived social dimension, Intention to use, Perceived usability, Anxiety. Based on our findings, it seems there is a critical disjunction between researchers' efforts to equip social robots with human manners and social intelligence and participants' rejection of this technology precisely because it mimics being human. Further, we report that ICT familiarity as assessed using PISA's Information Communication Technology—ICT familiarity factors is related to robot acceptability. These findings need further examination to inform educational robotics design and Human-Robot Interaction research and teacher education and training. Practitioners notes What is already known about this topic In the age of robotic technology, teachers face requirements to prepare students for work and life with social robots. Social robots are tested for classroom integration. Teachers' readiness to implement robot lessons depends on their beliefs about social robotic technology's contribution to teaching. Research and development in the field of social robotics still tend to focus more frequently on technology applications rather than pedagogical issues and advancing teaching and learning. What this paper adds Participants refuse to accept the idea of social robot-based instruction. The identified belief pattern is based mainly on the perceived social dimension, intention to use, perceived usability and anxiety. Participants critically perceive the robot's social dimension. Some of PISA's ICT familiarity factors are related to robots acceptability factors. Implication for policy and/or practice The policy and practice need to address how social robots could be integrated into current teaching and learning practices and more importantly how could robotic technology facilitate innovative pedagogical models for effective and efficient learning. The introduction of social robots should follow instructional design requirements and not merely technological advancement. Teacher initial education has to provide social robotic learning environments for pre-service teachers to experiment and design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceptability; embodied humanoid social robots; ICT familiarity; pre-service teachers","Computer aided instruction; Economic and social effects; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Machine design; Personnel training; Robot learning; Robotics; Social robots; Students; Teaching; Incremental innovation; Information communication technology; Pre-service teacher education; Research and development; Technological advancement; Technology application; Technology Integration; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Educational robots"

The Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention (BESI) for the Dementia Caregiver Empowerment system uses sensing technology, smartwatches, tablets, and data analytics to detect and predict agitation in persons living with dementia and to provide just-in-time notifications and dyad-specific intervention recommendations to caregivers. The BESI system has shown that there is a valid relationship between dementia-related agitation and environmental factors and that caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system. Objective: The aim of this study is to obtain input from caregivers of persons living with dementia on the value, usability, and acceptability of the BESI system in the home setting and obtain their insights and recommendations for the next stage of system development. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design with thematic analysis was used to analyze 10 semistructured interviews with caregivers. The interviews comprised 16 questions, with an 80% (128/160) response rate. Results: Postdeployment caregiver feedback about the BESI system and the overall experience were generally positive. Caregivers acknowledged the acceptability of the system by noting the ease of use and saw the system as a fit for them. Functionality issues such as timeliness in agitation notification and simplicity in the selection of agitation descriptors on the tablet interface were identified, and caregivers indicated a desire for more word options to describe agitation behaviors. Agitation intervention suggestions were well received by the caregivers, and the resulting decrease in the number and severity of agitation events helped confirm that the BESI system has good value and acceptability. Thematic analysis suggested several subjective experiences and yielded the themes of usefulness and helpfulness. Conclusions: This study determined preferences for assessing caregiver strain and burden, explored caregiver acceptance of the technology system (in-home sensors, actigraph or smart watch technology, and tablet devices), discerned caregiver insights on the burden and stress of caring for persons living with dementia experiencing agitation in dementia, and solicited caregiver input and recommendations for system changes. The themes of usefulness and helpfulness support the use of caregiver knowledge and experience to inform further development of the technology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agitation; Caregiver; Dementia; Dyad; Home-based; Just-in-time notifications; Qualitative; Sensors; Smart health; Wearable technology",""

However, there has been insufficient empirical research on the brand personality of Korean dance. In the context of using culture and the arts to support national competitiveness, we examine traditional Korean dance in terms of a potential brand personality that can influence the perceptions of global consumers. We look at how this brand can affect consumer perceptions of how easy it is to learn Korean dances as well as their perceptions of the physical benefits of these dances. The respondents included global consumers who had listened to or watched Korean dance music and videos on TV and the Internet, searched for and watched Korean dance videos on YouTube, and searched for Korean dance information on social media at least once. A survey was conducted over the course of four months, from October 2020 to January 2021, in four countries: South Korea, the USA, the UK, and South Africa. Valid data were obtained from 649 individuals. We conducted an empirical study by applying and integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) to the brand personality of Korean dance. A structural equation model was used to analyze the responses. The brand personality of Korean dance enhanced its perceived ease of use and its perceived usefulness among global consumers, which led to positive attitudes toward the dances. Furthermore, it led to a sustainable behavioral intention, that is, interest in learning traditional Korean dances. Since no studies have integrated Korean dance into a single brand personality to use it as a cultural asset, this study makes considerable contributions to the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand personality; Global consumers; Korean dance; Sustainable behavioral intention; Technological acceptance model","competitiveness; global change; numerical model; perception; psychology; social media; sustainability; technological change; South Africa; South Korea; United Kingdom; United States"

However, the success of the new technology does not only depend on engineering practices and techniques but also involves social, political, and economic factors, as well as public acceptance. The discussion about CCS in Brazil is recent and few papers addressing Brazilian public perception and engagement with CCS were found. In this sense, this paper aims to analyze the environmental awareness about climate change and the citizens’ perception of CCS technology. A public perception survey was conducted with 800 people in two Brazilian cities. Descriptive statistical techniques combined with hypothesis tests were performed to depict the results and to verify associations between different demographic groups to climate change issues and support for the development of CCS technology in Brazil. The results show that the public is aware of climate change and its consequences. However, despite public support for governmental development and investments in CCS technology, investments to mitigate climate change are not a priority for the population. Only 2% and 5% of interviewed citizens in the cities of São Mateus and Vitória, respectively, considered investments in climate change mitigation as a priority. More than 70% of respondents considered that other social elements, as health, public safety, and job creation, should be prioritized by the Brazilian government. The results suggest that the population needs more information about CCS technology and its impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate change; Mitigation; Public awareness; Survey","Carbon capture; Environmental technology; Investments; Statistical tests; Surveys; Awareness perceptions; Economic factors; Engineering practices; Engineering techniques; Environmental awareness; Mitigation; Political factors; Public awareness; Public perception; Social factor; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental values; investment; perception; public attitude; survey method; Brazil"

The diverse needs of ICV users (e.g., drivers and passengers) can be satisfied during commuting and traveling. However, considering the limitations of transportation environment, the potential attitude and usage behavior for the upcoming ICV infotainment directly impacts on the traffic and road safety in sustainable cities. In this paper, we conduct an online and offline survey to investigate the key factors influencing the user attitude and intention of ICV infotainment, where the answers of a total of 502 valid respondents (i.e., IVI users) are collected in China. A conceptual technology acceptance model with the constructs of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), consumer innovation (CI), and perceived risk (PR) is established, and then assessed via partial least square structural equation modeling. We find that the constructs of PU, PEOU, CI, and SI have a direct impact on attitude and usage intention, of which 46.8% and 73.4% of variance, respectively, are explained. The respondents show positive attitudes and higher usage intention towards the ICV infotainment. Although PR has insignificant path with attitude and intention, the driving experience moderation effect exists between PR and usage intention.

Its services should be affordable not only for professional sports clubs but also for their amateur counterparts. Despite limited resources, clubs want to increase their attractiveness through new technologies and meet members' needs. This paper examines the factors that lead to the acceptance of Asport services by sports clubs. In addition, the willingness to pay for these services is evaluated. Pricing is critical to success in innovation and also because of the limited financial resources of sports clubs. Based on the literature research, a conceptual model was developed based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model (UTAUT), tested using an online survey of Swiss amateur football clubs, and evaluated using regression analysis. The study findings show that social environment exerts the strongest influence on behavioral intention, defined as “acceptance” in this paper. Furthermore, the two independent variables, performance expectancy and effort expectancy, have a significant effect on user acceptance. In contrast to the original model (UTAUT), this paper demonstrates the direct influence of attitude to use. Of the independent variables, facilitating conditions have an additional effect on attitude to use. The results demonstrate that it is not acceptance but attitude to use that influences willingness to pay. An in-depth evaluation of willingness to pay shows that the optimal price point is 83.3% lower than the price offered by the company; however, there are budget-dependent variations in the assessment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceptance; distribution platform; sport; video production; willingness-to-pay",""

The apparent limitations of the hydraulic paradigm to solving this crisis are leading to a change in water management approaches. Recently, decentralized wastewater treatment systems have re-emerged as a partial solution to this problem. However, to implement these systems successfully, it is necessary not only to design this technology but also to have social support and willingness among citizens to use it. Previous studies have shown that these technologies are often perceived as being too costly, and people often do not consider the need for adopting them. However, it has also been pointed out that thinking about these technologies as a sustainable endeavor to reduce human impact on the environment can help to overcome the barriers to usage. Thus, we test whether priming environmental concerns before presenting information about decentralized wastewater treatment plants will increase acceptance of those technologies. In this study, we test whether priming environmental concerns can enhance the acceptance of decentralized wastewater treatment plants even when presenting disadvantages of the technology. In order to do so, we designed an experimental study with a sample of 287 people (85.7% women, M<inf>age</inf>=20, 28). The experimental design was 2 (priming the environmental concern vs. no priming)×2 (type of information: only advantages vs. advantages and disadvantages). The results showed that those in the environmental concern priming condition had more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward decentralized wastewater treatment plants than those in the control condition group. Participants who received only advantages information had a more positive perception toward the decentralized wastewater systems than in the condition, where disadvantages were present, but in the priming condition this difference was not significant. This implies that priming environmental concern helps to overcome the possible disadvantages that act as barriers to acceptance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","decentralized wastewater treatment plants; environmental concern priming; social acceptance; sustainable technologies; type of information; water problems",""

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are considered as one of the best sustainable alternatives to Internal Combustion (IC) engine vehicles. In order to develop fiscal and non-fiscal policy measures for EVs, a thorough understanding about its public acceptability is inevitable for its successful penetration. Even though many policies are purposefully made for improving the EV adoption in developing countries such as India, its market share is still negligible compared to conventional vehicles. Therefore, a case study was conducted in a representative town in India by using a questionnaire survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was adopted to evaluate the influence of various attitudinal factors on EV purchase intention of the individuals. The results of the study revealed that, the attitudinal factors such as perceived benefits, social influence, price acceptance, performance, technological consciousness, and marketing, distribution and after-sales have positive effect on EV purchase intention. But, the factors like perceived barriers, policy attributes and perceived usefulness and ease of use causes an impeditive effect on EV adoption. People traveling short distances, having lower income, higher education and more experience with driving conventional vehicles is found to favor the adoption of EVs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Electric vehicles; Policy implications; Purchase intention; Structural equation modeling; Vehicular emission","climate change; developing world; education; electric vehicle; higher education; perception; policy approach; policy development; public attitude; questionnaire survey; sustainability; transportation system; India"

However, using technology is not as simple as bringing equipment into the school and home and initiating its usage; these are just the first steps into a more complex and ambitious achievement of using technology as a catalyst for a shift toward new learning models in remote and hybrid settings. A theoretical framework based on the theory of acceptance and use of technology and social cognitive learning theory was used to analyse data from a survey completed by 4,600 parents from 19 countries during the national lockdowns in 2020. Regression models and thematic analysis of open-ended responses were employed to identify factors that contribute to parental acceptance and use of technology in support of their children’s learning. Our results show that parents are more engaged in children’s learning when well-structured technological tools are provided or suggested by schools, and when parents are socially influenced by the opinions of other parents, teachers, children, the general public, relatives, etc. Conversely, they are less engaged when they perceive the technological tools to be challenging and beyond their knowledge or skills. The study’s findings have practical implications for governments and school leaders, who need to be aware of the factors likely to determine the use of technology at home and take action to meet parents’ needs when using technology to support learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","home learning environment; parental engagement; school closures; technology acceptance model; use of technology",""

An increasing number of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) try to implement AT/AR in order to create a stimulating environment for aging well and to reduce workload for professional care staff. The implementation of new technologies in an organization may lead to noticeable cultural changes in terms of social interactions and care practices associated with positive or negative emotions for the employees. This applies especially for LTCFs with high rates of vulnerable residents affected by increasing care needs and specific ethics in nursing and cultural rules within the setting. Thus, systematic consideration in leadership management of emotions and ethical aspects is essential for stakeholders involved in the implementation process. In this article, we explicitly focus on the emotions of the employees and leaders within LTCFs. We relate to direct consequences for the organizational well-being and culture, which is of course (indirectly) affecting patients and residents. While aspects of technology acceptance such as safety and usefulness are frequently discussed in academic literature, the topic of emotion-management and ethical questions during the organizational implementation process in LTCFs received little attention. Emotional culture entails affective values, ethical norms and perceptions of employees and further investigation is needed to address the importance of transformational leadership during implementation process. For this purpose, we developed a three-staged assessment tool for implementation of AT/AR in long-term care institutions. Acceptance (A), ethical acceptability (A) and emotional consequences (E) are considered as comprehensive assessment, in which emotional consequences comprise management aspects of transformational leadership (T), emotion-management (E) and organizational culture (O). Based on AAE and TEO, this paper presents an integrated framework illustrated with a illustrative example and aims to combine established approaches with ethical insights in order to unfold potentials of AT/AR in LTCSs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assistive robotics; assistive technologies; care homes; emotion management; ethics; long-term care; organization; quality of life",""

In addition to technical feasibility, issues concerning the normative requirements for their use are growing. This paper discusses the ethical, legal and social implications of the use of mixed reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in the therapy of elderly people with hypertension. It is based on the results of a study conducted as a part of the BMBF project BewARe. Methods: In the context of the above-mentioned background, an expert workshop was held with various stakeholders in an early phase of the BewARe project in accordance with the MEESTAR model, in which ethical, social and legal requirements for the development and use of AR/MR technologies were anticipated. The results of the workshop were subsequently evaluated using content analysis. Results: Content analysis identified eight main challenges for the development and use of AR/MR technologies in the therapy of elderly people with hypertension: ethical challenges for the decision-making and action capacity of older users (1), stereotyping (2), user-oriented development and implementation (3), data protection (4), support (5), health risks (6), social participation (7), and the need for an integrative approach (8). Discussion: In line with other studies, it can be shown that orientation towards medical guidelines and behavioral principles is essential to promote acceptance and adherence among end users and to minimize potential health risks. In addition, end users should be more strongly involved in the development process to overcome existing user stereotypes and establish qualification strategies for health-promoting use. Finally, legal and health economic framework conditions must be created to ensure data security and sustainable application concepts. Conclusion: For a successful diffusion of AR/MR applications in health care, a holistic implementation concept is required which must involve various groups of social actors. In this context, the article discusses eight main challenges that can be understood as current challenges in this process.; Hintergrund: Für die Sicherstellung einer bedarfsgerechten Gesundheitsversorgung, spielen elektronische Gesundheitsanwendungen eine immer größere Rolle. Neben Fragen der technischen Machbarkeit stellen sich vermehrt auch Fragen hinsichtlich der normativen Anforderungen an einen flächendeckenden Einsatz. Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert in diesem Zusammenhang die ethischen, rechtlichen und sozialen Implikationen des Einsatzes von Mixed- und Augmented Reality Technologien in der Therapie von älteren Menschen mit Hypertonie. Grundlage hierfür bilden die Ergebnisse eines MEESTAR Workshops im Rahmen des BMBF-Projektes BewARe. Methoden: Vor dem genannten Hintergrund wurde in einer frühen Phase des BewARe Projektes nach Maßgabe des MEESTAR-Modells ein Expert*innenworkshop mit unterschiedlichen Stakeholdern durchgeführt, in dessen Rahmen ethische, soziale und rechtliche Anforderungen an die Entwicklung und den Einsatz von MR/AR Technologien antizipiert wurden. Die Ergebnisse des Workshops wurden anschließend inhaltsanalytisch ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Im Zuge der inhaltsanalytischen Auswertung der antizipierten ethischen Anforderungen wurden acht zentrale Herausforderungen für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz von AR/MR Technologien in der Therapie von älteren Menschen mit Hypertonie herausgearbeitet und diskutiert: Restriktionen für die Entscheidungs- und Handlungsfähigkeit (1), Stereotypisierung (2), ethische Herausforderungen für die Entwicklung und Implementierung älterer Nutzer*innen (3), Datenschutz (4), Support (5), gesundheitliche Gefährdungen (6), soziale Teilhabe und Exklusion (7) sowie Erforderlichkeit eines integrativen Ansatzes (8). Diskussion: Im Einklang mit weiterführenden Studien kann gezeigt werden, dass eine Orientierung an medizinwissenschaftlichen und verhaltenstheoretischen Grundlagen zwingend erforderlich ist, um die Akzeptanz und Adhärenz der Endnutzer*innen zu fördern sowie nichtintendierte Folgen für deren physische und psychische Gesundheit zu minimieren. Darüber hinaus müssen potentielle Endnutzer*innen stärker in den Entwicklungsprozess integriert werden, um bestehende Nutzer*innenstereotype zu überwinden und die durch Technik eröffneten Möglichkeiten zur Förderung der Gesundheitskompetenz ausschöpfen zu können. Schließlich müssen rechtliche und gesundheitsökonomische Rahmenbedingungen geschaffen werden, um die Zweckmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung personenbezogener (Gesundheits-)Daten als auch nachhaltige Anwendungskonzepte in den bestehenden Versorgungsstrukturen abzusichern. Schlussfolgerung: Für die erfolgreiche Diffusion von AR/MR Anwendungen in die Gesundheitsversorgung ist ein umfassendes Implementierungskonzept erforderlich, an dessen Umsetzung unterschiedliche gesellschaftliche Akteursgruppen zu beteiligen sind. Der Beitrag diskutiert in diesem Zusammenhang acht zentrale Herausforderungen, die als aktuelle Problemstellungen in diesem Prozess verstanden werden können. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ELSIAR; Ethical challenges; Ethical requirements; Exergame; MEESTAR","aged; Germany; health care delivery; human; hypertension; Aged; Augmented Reality; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Hypertension"

However, an adjustment in subsidy schemes and breakout of COVID-19 appear to slow down the uptake of NEVs in the Chinese market. This raises the question of whether, other less costly, policy instruments can help the transformation towards cleaner vehicles. With the understanding that public support and user acceptance play a key role, we ask whether NEVs as part of increasingly popular car-sharing mode can gain further support, the increased uptake of new energy vehicles. To investigate this question, we perform an online survey, retrieving 1583 questionnaires, and scrutinize the perception of NEVs at the nexus with car-sharing. Relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior and ordered logistic regression model, we demonstrate that attitudes towards environmental protection and perceived benefits (economic and safety) play a key role in accelerating the adoption of shared electric cars. NEVs promotion policies need to specifically target groups by regions. Municipal agencies can substantially support NEV uptake by providing on-street parking exclusively for shared NEVs in cities, and information on the economic and social benefits of NEVs in rural areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Car-sharing; China; New energy vehicles; Ordered logistic regression model; Regional differences; Theory of planned behavior","Automotive industry; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Environmental impact; Surveys; Car industry; Car-sharing; China; Electric cars; Leverage points; New energy vehicles; Ordered logistic regression model; Perceived benefits; Regional differences; Theory of Planned Behavior; Regression analysis; car use; electric vehicle; environmental impact; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; regional pattern; regression analysis; technology adoption"

Our respondents' shared concern about environmental risks has already galvanized communities to take responsibility for implementing closed-loop alternatives to current agricultural inputs and waste management practices in their communities.

Given the demographic growth of the older adult population and the shortage of caregivers, there is a need for personal trainers for physical and cognitive activities. This study suggests that social robots can satisfy this demand and presents the development of “Gymmy”, a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults. The system design includes a humanoid mechanical-looking robot to demonstrate exercises, an RGB-Depth (RGB-D) camera to measure performance and a touch screen and speakers to provide instructions and feedback. Experiments with 26 older adults (65–84 years of age) were performed in home environments to examine the effect of users’ characteristics (age, gender, education and attitude toward robots), the addition of cognitive training and the success rate of the acceptability of a robot trainer. The results showed that age, attitude and education influenced the acceptance of the robotic system. The findings highlight the importance of customizing the system to the needs of different users and the role of meaningful feedback. The system was proven to be robust and reliable, demonstrating clear potential to be used as a personal trainer and as a means of motivating older adults. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistive robot; Human–robot interaction; Older adults; Robotic trainer; Social robot; Technology acceptance",""

While researchers have examined MOOC acceptance in a variety of contexts, the role of TTF as a mediating variable in evaluating education sustainability has not been explored using the technology acceptance model (TAM). As a result, the aim of this study was to create a new paradigm by combining two theories: TTF and TAM. Therefore, this study surveyed 277 university students from public universities using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to learn about their perceptions toward MOOCs as a method of achieving higher education sustainability. According to the findings, perceived ease of use had a positive impact on perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and social influence, which in turn had a positive impact on task-technology fit and MOOCs use as a method of sustainability in higher education. Task-technology fit also had a positive impact on MOOC use as a method of sustainability. Finally, the role of task-technology fit and MOOCs in educational sustainability had a positive effect on students satisfaction and academic performance. As a result, the use of MOOCs in learning processes should be encouraged in higher education institutions to ensure their long-term viability (sustainability). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","MOOCs; Sustainability in higher education; TAM; TTF","higher education; Internet; perception; performance assessment; student; sustainability; university sector"

Thus, for banks, their understanding of customer segments in terms of the degree of various mobile banking services availed by consumers is critical to the sustainability of the banking industry. This study integrates trust and lifestyle compatibility in the technology acceptance model (TAM) to develop a conceptual framework for discussing consumer attitude and intention towards mobile banking services. A sample of 367 respondents was asked to complete a survey. This article attempts to segment the consumers into distinct groups based on whether users avail mobile banking services or not. The hierarchical clustering technique was used for segmentation. Three clusters were obtained which were labelled as Active User, Traditional Follower and Laggard. A profile of each cluster was developed in terms of their demographics (age, gender, income, etc.). Further, analysis of variance was conducted to determine whether antecedents to mobile banking, namely ease of use, convenience, efficiency, trust and lifestyle compatibility significantly differ between the clusters. For antecedents where the difference was found to be significant, a post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine the difference between various cluster pairs. A similar analysis was conducted for Attitude and Intention variables to find out whether it varies between the cluster pairs. The results showed that a statistically significant difference exists between clusters with respect to the various antecedents to mobile banking, attitude and intention.

E-learning is being increasingly adopted in the world; however, the factors that influence the intention of users for accepting the e-learning technology have not been sufficiently explored, particularly in developing countries. Although many e-learning acceptance models do exist, the research on a user experience (UX)-based e-learning acceptance model is still lacking. As UX is one of the crucial factors for the acceptance of an e-learning portal, this research study aims to develop and validate a UX-based e-learning acceptance framework for sustainable higher education. In this connection, a web-based responsive e-learning portal for university students has been developed. The portal can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, and on any device, making the learning sustainable. The UX-based e-learning acceptance framework is developed by integrating the selected constructs of a widely accepted UX model, technology acceptance model (TAM), and four well-known constructs from various technology acceptance models. The constructs are appeal, pleasure, satisfaction, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, information quality, self-efficacy, social influence, benefits, and behavioral intention, which can predict the intentions of the students for acceptance of the e-learning portal. The data were collected from 650 university students using online and manual questionnaires. After data screening, 513 valid responses were further analyzed using structural equation modeling. According to the results, the framework fits the data well. The constructs satisfaction, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, information quality, self-efficacy, social influence, and benefits have a statistically significant effect on the behavioral intention of the students regarding the acceptance of the e-learning portal. The construct perceived ease of use has a statistical significant impact on perceived usefulness and pleasure. The construct appeal has a statistical significant impact on pleasure and satisfaction. Similarly, the construct pleasure has also a positive statistical significant impact on satisfaction. This research study contributes to the e-learning acceptance models by developing and validating the UX-based e-learning acceptance framework for sustainable higher education. The framework provides important insights for the acceptance of university based e-learning portals in the context of developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance model; Conceptual framework; E-learning; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable higher education; User experience","carbon sequestration; detection method; higher education; learning; model validation; perception; questionnaire survey; sustainability; university sector"

However, in the last years, climate-damaging emissions did not decrease in accordance with the Paris Agreement, and important societal actors failed to implement effective strategies that could promote a socio-ecological transformation. Sufficiency with its underlying ‘mind-set’ can be a seen as leverage point for transformation and thus is targeted within our qualitative study. To explore barriers that prevent the implementation of knowledge about the sufficiency approach and ways to encourage sufficiency orientation on a societal level, we conducted interviews with experts from science, politics and economy (N = 21). Using qualitative content analysis, we identified keys for change, i.e., narratives, rewards and recognition, time structures and responsibilities that could have a leveraging effect towards system transformation. We propose an exploratory framework that points out main barriers, keys in terms of levers and experts’ visions towards a sufficiency-oriented society. Furthermore, we outline that the sufficiency discourse contains ambiguities and varieties concerning the experts’ perceptions regarding effective levers for a transformation. Through brief discourse pattern analysis, we highlight different perceptions regarding the role of technology, social responsibility and the societal change and time. The proposed framework can inspire future research and policy-making on sufficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behaviour change; Collective action; Future narratives; Intention-behaviour gap; Leverage points; Sufficiency orientation",""

Background Despite the enormous potential of wearable payments, studies investigating the adoption of this technology are scarce. Methodology This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with four addi-tional variables (Perceived Security, Trust, Perceived Cost, and Attractiveness of Alternatives) to investigate behavioral intentions to adopt wearable payments. The moderating role of gender was also examined. Data collected from 311 Kuwaiti respondents were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). Contribution The research model provided in this study may be useful for academics and scholars conducting further research into m-payments adoption, specifically in the case of wearable payments where studies are scarce and still in the nascent stage; hence, addressing the gap in existing literature. Further, this study is the first to have specifically investigated wearable payments in the State of Kuwait; therefore, enriching Kuwaiti context literature. Findings This study empirically demonstrated that behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments is mainly predicted by attractiveness of alternatives, perceived useful-ness, perceived ease of use, perceived security and trust, while the role of per-ceived cost was found to be insignificant. Recommendations for Practitioners This study draws attention to the importance of cognitive factors, such as per-ceived usefulness and ease of use, in inducing users' behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments. As such, in the case of perceived usefulness, smart wearable devices manufacturers and banks enhance the functionalities and fea-tures of these devices, expand on the financial services provided through them, and maintain the availability, performance, effectiveness, and efficiency of these tools. In relation to ease of use, smart wearable devices should be designed with an easy to use, high quality and customizable user interface. The findings of this study demonstrated the influence of trust and perceived security in motivating users to adopt wearable payments, Hence, banks are advised to focus on a rela-tionship based on trust, especially during the early stages of acceptance and adoption of wearable payments. Recommendations for Researchers The current study validated the role of attractiveness of alternatives, which was never examined in the context of wearable payments. This, in turn, provides a new dimension about a determinant factor considered by customers in predict-ing their behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments. Impact on Society This study could be used in other countries to compare and verify the results. Additionally, the research model of this study could also be used to investigate other m-payments methods, such as m-wallets and P2P payments. Future Research Future studies should investigate the proposed model in a cross-country and cross-cultural perspective with additional economic, environmental, and techno-logical factors. Also, future research may conduct a longitudinal study to explain how temporal changes and usage experience affect users' behavioral intentions to adopt wearable payments. Finally, while this study included both influencing factors and inhibiting factors, other factors such as social influence, perceived compatibility, personal innovativeness, mobility, and customization could be considered in future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gender; Kuwait; Mobile payment; Near field communication; Smart wearables; Wearable payment","Costs; Electronic money; Near field communication; User experience; User interfaces; Behavioral intention; Perceived ease of use; Perceived securities; Perceived usefulness; Personal innovativeness; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); Wearable technology"

Automated vehicle acceptance was modelled as a function of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) constructs performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DIT) constructs compatibility and trialability, as well as trust and automated shuttle sharing. The results show that after adding the DIT constructs, automated shuttle sharing, and trust to the model, the effect of performance expectancy on behavioural intention was no longer significant. Instead, compatibility with current travel was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention to use automated shuttles. It was further found that individuals who are willing to share rides in an automated shuttle with fellow travelers (i.e., automated shuttle sharing) and who trust automated shuttles (i.e., trust) are more likely to intend to use automated shuttles (i.e., behavioural intention). The highest mean rating was obtained for believing that automated shuttles are easy to use, while the lowest mean rating was obtained for feeling safe inside the automated shuttle without any type of supervision. The analysis revealed a preference for the supervision of the automated shuttle via an external control room to the supervision by a human steward onboard. We recommend future research to investigate the hypothesis that compatibility could serve as an even stronger predictor of the behavioural intention to use automated shuttles in public transport than performance expectancy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated shuttle sharing; Automated shuttles; Automated vehicle acceptance; DIT; UTAUT","Economic and social effects; Automated vehicles; Behavioural intentions; Diffusion of innovation theory; Facilitating conditions; Social influence; Structural equation modeling; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Automation"

However, while innovative energy technologies are introduced in order to support global targets for sustainability and service-delivery while also directly benefiting low-income households (e.g. by reducing the monetary costs of energy), there is widespread evidence that low-income urban dwellers do not always readily accept these technologies. Typically, the urban poor are blamed for failing to adopt new technologies, with little consideration for underlying socio-cultural causes. Using examples drawn from qualitative research in low-income settlements in Mumbai and Cape Town, this paper demonstrates the role of socio-cultural attitudes and practices in affecting social acceptance of domestic solar energy interventions. Focusing specifically on perceptions of normality and practices of social capital, both of which are connected to collective social influence, the paper reveals how these concepts affect the socio-cultural acceptance of new energy technologies amongst low-income urban dwellers in the global South. Furthermore, we argue that adopting a socio-cultural perspective is a crucial, but often overlooked, aspect of scholarly and policy analyses of, and strategies for, energy transitions in the global South. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes and perceptions; Cape Town; Energy transitions; Mumbai; Normality; Social acceptance; Social capital; Socio-cultural; Technology diffusion",""

It examines the factors influencing the behavioural intention of the users to adopt BT with a blended model built on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and self-determination theory (SDT). This research develops a prescriptive model to demonstrate how the stakeholders are interested in adopting BT for the taxing system. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained through a structured questionnaire from the stakeholders of the taxing system, including tax policymakers, tax commissioners, tax officers, lawyers, tax consultants and the taxpayers. Statistical analyses were performed using partial least square-structural equation modelling. Findings: Results reveal that out of the two primary TAM antecedents known as usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEU), PU has a significant influence on the BT adoption intention. The only cognitive variable called autonomous motivation picked from SDT has a positive and significant impact on BT adoption for tax purpose as well. Finally, trust is found to be another important determinant for explaining stakeholders’ intention to adopt BT for an efficient taxing system where transparency can be ensured. Research limitations/implications: The proposed model does not include any moderator though there might be a moderating effect in this regard. The variation described in the behavioural intention to adopt BT by the predictors is half of the total possible variations. Hence, the inclusion of variables such as social influence and controlled motivation could be interesting. Practical implications: This study is expected to provide valuable insights into policymaking for tax administrations to enhance the tax collection net and maintain transparency and efficiency in the taxing system. Social implications: This research has social consequences for a recently graduated developing economy such as Bangladesh, where transparency and efficiency are a matter of question. Because BT adoption can assure a convenient and favourable environment for the taxpayers upholding the principles of taxation, it can play a significant role by ensuring social justice and equity through a transparent and effective taxing system. Originality/value: This research is among the first few studies to address the issue of implementing a modern technology such as BT for an efficient taxing system from a developing country perspective. Furthermore, it combined TAM and SDT to propose a hybrid model for explaining behavioural intention to adopt an emerging technology such as blockchain, which is a new phenomenon. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bangladesh; Blockchain technology adoption; Hybrid model based on TAM and SDT; Taxing system; Transparency and effectiveness",""

Since the industrial revolution, the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased appreciably. This has been attributed to the utilization of fossil fuels for energy generation coupled with the clearing of forests and extensive manufacturing of some industrial products such as cement. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide has been widely linked to climate change and the Earth's temperature. A drastic approach is therefore needed in terms of policy formulation to address this global challenge. Carbon capture and storage are reliable tools that can be introduced to the industrial sector to address this issue. Therefore, this review presents a thorough investigation of the various technologies that can be harnessed to capture carbon dioxide. The cost associated with the capture, transport, and storage of the carbon dioxide is discussed. Socio-economic aspects of carbon capture and storage technologies are also presented in this review. Factors influencing public awareness of the technology and perceptions associated with carbon capture and storage should be a point for consideration in future research activities relating to this novel technology. This, in effect, this will ensure effective expert knowledge communication to the general public and foster social acceptance of this technology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuel; Oil and gas; Sequestration","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cement manufacture; Earth (planet); Emission control; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Atmospheric concentration; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon dioxide emissions; Industrial revolutions; Research activities; Socioeconomic aspects; Various technologies; Cement industry; bioethanol; carbon dioxide; cement; fossil fuel; methane; oxygen; sodium chloride; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; perception; socioeconomic impact; technological development; technology adoption; absorption; adsorption; air quality; Article; bioenergy; biomass; carbon capture and storage; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; cement industry; climate change; combustion; cost benefit analysis; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental temperature; iron and steel industry; membrane technology; oil industry; petrochemical industry; pollution control; priority journal; socioeconomics; soil acidity; water supply"

However, only a few studies have focused on MSVP users’ post-acceptance behavior. To clarify this issue of sustainable usage, this study analyzed users’ post-acceptance habit formation by incorporating perceived interactivity and perceived enjoyment into the expectation-confirmation theory of the information system continuance (ECT-IS) model using structural equation modelling. We developed and distributed an online questionnaire and collected 219 valid responses from Chinese MSVP users. Our results show that satisfaction is the foremost factor in determin-ing users’ habit formation as it completely mediates the influence of confirmation and perceived interactivity. We also show that perceived enjoyment positively influences habit formation directly and indirectly. Nonetheless, we note that sustainable usage should form the basis of continuous satisfaction from user experience due to a few missing links with regard to modulation in habitual usage. Therefore, we suggest that MSVPs should enhance their content recommendation algorithms using technologies such as deep-learning forecasting to improve users’ satisfaction by increasing perceived enjoyment. We also show that the influence of perceived interactivity on habit formation is effective only when fully mediated by satisfaction. Thus, we recommend that MSVPs should diversify their interaction mechanisms, for instance, by introducing mass creators that promote users’ habit formation by enhancing their satisfaction on the platform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ECT-IS theory; Habit formation; Mobile short-video platform; Post-acceptance behavior","algorithm; communication network; consumption behavior; media role; perception; social network; sustainability; World Wide Web"

However, education should remain welcoming and supportive to all the learners as it is important to keep the students’ behavioural intention in any form of learning environment. Thus, this study is significant as online learning is leading the trend of education now. Past studies revealed that the factors of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions under the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model affect learners’ behavioural intention to use online learning. This study intended to identify the most significant factors that influence TESL postgraduate students’ behavioural intention towards the use of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also examined the relationship amongst the four factors and postgraduate students’ behavioural intention to use online learning. The participants consisted of 169 postgraduate students at a public university in Malaysia. To achieve the aim, the study utilized a survey design using a questionnaire. The results from regression analysis revealed that all of the factors have positive effects on postgraduate students’ behavioural intention to use online learning.

Digital technologies such as Blockchain have shown potential in gaining competitive advantages for enterprises in such situations. This study aims to provide an insight into how to gain consumer loyalty through the use of modern and efficient Blockchain technology. In contrast to the current literature, this study combined the technology acceptance model of planned behavior theory, social exchange theory to explain the loyalty of an online travel agency (OTA) consumer. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from citizens in Hangzhou, a city full of technological innovation atmosphere. Using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS©, responses from 1403 citizens were analyzed. Social norm was discovered to have a positive and significant association with the consumers’ attitude toward technology and thus enhancing the perceived usability and hedonism of OTA application, which can increase consumer loyalty. The findings suggested OTAs may gain consumers’ loyalty through adopting Blockchain technology, and local governments have played a key role in creating such an environment. New technologies have become essential professional and social tools for society.

The present paper aims to determine factors influencing students’ behavioral intention to use a popular educational social network site, Edmodo. Using an extension of the technology acceptance model, we analyzed quantitative responses of 218 university students, registered in an Edmodo supported course. Data were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results highlighted that intention was significantly predicted by its antecedents. More specifically, the attitude was the most important factor, whilst perceived usefulness had a moderate impact on predicting intention. Perceived ease of use predicted perceived usefulness directly and also it influenced intention indirectly through attitude. External antecedents of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were all significant. Discussion and implications were drawn based on the results. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Understanding why users accept or reject a particular information system is a common research area. Technology acceptance model (TAM) is used to explain individuals’ acceptance and adoption of different technologies. Social Networking Sites (SNSs) have been used to enrich learning. However, the adoption of educational SNS studies is limited. What this paper adds This study is one of the first attempts for employing extended TAM that scrutinizes factors influencing university students’ intention to use Edmodo as an educational SNS and a learning management system (LMS) in teaching and learning environments. External antecedents included in the model (subjective norms, output quality, perceptions of external control, perceived enjoyment, technological complexity, and self-efficacy) significantly predicted university students’ intention to use Edmodo as an educational SNS and LMS. Major factors driving the intention to use Edmodo were attitude and perceived usefulness. Implications for practice and/or policy Considering that the attitude was found to have the strongest influence on the intention to use Edmodo, instructors may attach prominent importance to foster students’ positive attitudes toward Edmodo use. Instructors may design virtual learning environments with collaborative activities on SNS to increase students’ perceived usefulness. Designers and developers of an educational SNS should design interfaces that should be not only less complex but also more enjoyable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Edmodo; educational social network sites; learning management systems; structural equation modeling; technology acceptance model","Education computing; Least squares approximations; Social networking (online); Behavioral intention; Extended technology acceptance models; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Social Network Sites; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Students"

This research is a mixed-method study with emphasis on quantitative research. A total of 559 Israeli adolescents aged 12 to 18 participated in the study, of whom 222 (40%) were immigrants residing for up to four years in the country. To characterize the absorption process experienced by the immigrant youths, we used the life cycle assessment (LCA) mechanism. We identified a 2-class model. The first group, 36% of the immigrant youths who participated in the study, was characterized by a positive feeling regarding their experience of the absorption process. Time in the country of absorption (under two years and from two years to four years) did not change their approach to the process they experienced. Immigrant adolescents feel that thanks to the mobile technologies, the translations, databases, numerous applications, and groups on the social networks, they are able to face the challenges and difficulties they encounter in the process of absorption in the new country. We found that the positive process of identity building by immigrant youths in the digital age is a combination of interactions with those who remain in the country of origin and significant interactions in the new society, especially in schools, fostering a sense of belonging, sharing, acceptance, a sense of being needed, and attention, which are likely to create a sense of resilience in immigrant youths. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alienation; Belonging; Equal opportunity; Immigrant; Information and communication technology (ICT); Teenagers",""

With this aim, the conceptual model was proposed to examine the impact of perceived risk on BI directly and indirectly via unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 along with its interactionist relationship with trust. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling technique is used to analyze data collected from 677 bank customers via personal contact using a self-administered questionnaire. Findings: The results indicate that perceived risk as a multi-dimensional construct has a direct and indirect impact on BI via performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation and price value. Moreover, it was found that trust moderates the relationship between perceived risk and BI. Practical implications: This study suggests that banks should create a trust-building mechanism in the online banking environment and develop certain risk management strategies such as providing detailed and thorough information, money-back guarantee and reassurance services to enhance confidence among the customers to use such services. The banks should also devote valuable efforts in designing website interface with improved security features to facilitate usability and reliability of online banking services. Originality/value: The present study makes an important contribution to the existing literature on e-commerce, especially in the field of online banking, by proposing an interactionist model between perceived risk and trust. The proposed model has never been examined in the relevant literature and could be used to provide a solid theoretical foundation in the context of online banking adoption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral intention; Online banking; Perceived risk; Trust; UTAUT2",""

DE has not only replaced the traditional education method as in social sciences and lifelong learning opportunities but also has significantly strengthened traditional education in mathematics, science, and engineering fields that require practical and intensive study. However, it is deprived of supporting some key elements found in traditional educational approaches such as (i) modern computer laboratories with installed special software suitable for the student’s field of interest; (ii) adequate staff for mainte-nance and proper functioning of laboratories; (iii) face‐to‐face technical support; (iv) license fees.

People use mobile applications that provide location-based service either directly or indirectly to share location with their smartphones. With the increase in the use of applications that determine location information by determining location information on mobile devices, mobile applications have become an important research area for user behavior. These applications are also utilized by users for communication and socialization purposes. The literature has usually focused on popular social media applications and studies on location-based applications (LBAs) have been insufficient. In this study, we investigate the impact of location-based services, such as Swarm and Foursquare. This study uses the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the expectation confirmation model (ECM) to understand why users continue using mobile applications. This article examines the role of hedonic comprised of application aesthetics and perceived enjoyment and utilitarian benefits (comprised of application quality and application utility) for consumer behavior in the development of application markets on satisfaction and application continuance intention. Besides, we show the benefits of the strongest effect on application users. By using the mediation satisfaction effect between hedonic and utilitarian benefits; we test the application continuance intention with regression analyses and the Sobel test. We surveyed young subjects as our sapling frame who regularly use mobile applications. We collected data from 400 users by convenience sampling method to test our hypotheses. Given our findings, we show that utilitarian and hedonic benefits are positively related to the application continuance intention. Besides, we show that satisfaction significantly mediates the relationship between hedonic/utilitarian benefits and application continuance intention. Since the main purpose of the application developers is using the application per se in the long term, they need to focus chiefly on user satisfaction. We also show that determining the relevant factors that affect application continuance intention positively is important for the businesses in a competitive environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Application continuance intention; Hedonic benefits; Location-based applications; Satisfaction; Utilitarian benefits","Consumer behavior; Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Location; Mobile computing; Regression analysis; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Telecommunication services; Application developers; Competitive environment; Continuance intentions; Expectation-confirmation models; Location information; Location-based applications; Perceived enjoyment; Technology acceptance model; Location based services"

The present study pursued synthesising a plethora of existing literature and contextualised the significance of seven broad categories of potential determinants that significantly affect patients’ acceptance and adoption intentions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, service quality, privacy and data security, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The partial least square structural equation modeling technique was employed to test the conceptual model and research hypotheses. A cross-sectional survey was administered among 500 telemedicine users in randomly selected rural and remote areas of Bangladesh. Excluding self-efficacy and ease of use, five determinants expressively contributed to patients’ acceptance of telemedicine adoption, explaining 65% of the variance (R2) in behavioural Intention. The empirical findings have the quality of rigour obtained from rich data sets in health informatics and can contribute to build telemedicine into an institutionalised health infrastructure in Bangladesh and similar settings.

Mobile learning has been adopted by most learning institution as a mobile technology that allows learners to access learning materials and share information among themselves and respective educators easily and quickly. This article discusses the intention of users in learning environment adopting m-learning, their perceptions as well as factors that hinder implementation of m-learning in the gulf region. Effective mobile technology adoption also enhances knowledge management through mobile applications that allow information capture, storage, retrieval and sharing. This study uses systematic literature review to collect information from post 2017 studies previous conducted by other researchers. Articles were searched through highly ranked databases from which 657 journals were identified. After the screening and eligibility assessment, 24 journals were retrieved. The back and forward search retrieved 4 more journals bringing the total to 28 journals that were included in the study. Based on this information, a conceptual model is developed to help assess the m-learning perceptions, adoption intentions and factors influencing its adoption among learning institutions in the gulf region. This model is built based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Based on the developed model, main constructs such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence are greatly impacted by other factors like learner's creativity and mobility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","effort expectancy; knowledge management; M-learning; mobile technology; performance expectancy",""

We lay out a conceptual basis for considering such changes and their social impacts. Cities are increasingly recognized as complex social-ecological-technological systems in which sustainability and climate resilience require environmental function to be paired with innovative technology. Smart technologies for real-time monitoring and autonomous operation promise innovations in urban landscape management. However, this promise can be fully realized only with adequate consideration of social impacts. Drawing on literature in landscape studies, environmental psychology, behavioral economics, public health, and aesthetics, we initiate a discussion connecting everyday experiences of urban nature with the social impacts of smart nature-based solutions and with local communities’ support for their implementation. We describe what makes pleasant everyday experiences of urban nature and their related well-being benefits and social and cultural values, and we elucidate how these experiences depend on perceivable landscape characteristics that are only sometimes directly linked to environmental functions. Then, based on this literature, we speculate about how adopting smart technologies to manage nature-based solutions may noticeably change the landscape in novel ways and have unintended negative impacts on everyday experiences of urban nature. We illustrate this with an example: smart stormwater management of retention ponds. We conclude that the risk of degraded everyday experiences of nature must be considered and addressed in the development of smart nature-based solutions. If pleasant everyday experiences are ensured through appropriate design, smart nature-based solutions may not only realize societal co-benefits, but also gain acceptance and continued support from the public for the whole set of ecosystem services they deliver. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aesthetics; Cultural ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Landscape design; Urban greenspace","ecosystem service; esthetics; greenspace; landscape ecology; technology; urban design"

Further, the change of these topics throughout time is explored. To do this, the qualitative content analysis of comments below news articles concerning autonomous vehicles on popular Czech Internet websites was performed to extract main discussed topics. With a huge development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and its technology, the question of successful implementation arises. The acceptance of this technology by the end users stands for an important factor of the implementation. For this, general attitudes toward autonomous vehicles and various concerns of people provide important information. The aim of this paper is to explore main topics and concerns regarding the issue of autonomous vehicles in the Czech population. The qualitative analysis of internet discussions beneath news articles about autonomous vehicles (AVs) on popular Czech news portals was performed. Two separated data collections were performed for a total of 17 articles from July 2014 to February 2020 to address the changes in attitudes through time. Content analysis revealed a general skepticism and a large number of concerns. The negativity and fear of the Czech discussants stemmed mainly from insufficient knowledge of the topic. Content analysis revealed main topics concerned the introduction of autonomous mobility into general practice in terms of time (when), experience (especially previous negative experience with elements of control automation), and analogy (comparisons to other modes of transport). Other important topics addressed driving pleasure, (dis)trust of manufacturers, legal and ethical questions about AV, risk of hacker attacks, reactions of drivers of conventional vehicles, carsharing, financial use of AV, manual takeover, application of AV only for some modes of transportation (e.g., freight transport), and a difficulty of introducing AVs into the Czech environment. In contrast to foreign opinion polls, there were no topics related to privacy and the misuse of personal data. It was not possible to find socio-demographic variables from the discussion threads, but information about the preference of news portals by older age groups was obtained from the data on the monitored portals. Assuming that authors of the comments were older people, the negative attitude towards AV corresponds to the current literature. In order to ensure representative data, it will be necessary to identify socio-demographic variables and the extension of the analyzed discussion threads to social networks as part of further research. Without these preconditions, it will be difficult to determine accurate evaluations and possibly to create an educational campaign for the general public focused on autonomous mobility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated vehicles; Autonomous vehicles; Driverless cars; Internet discussions",""

Results: As expected, factors necessary for the use of app services such as performance expectancy, social influence, price value, facilitating conditions, security, and aesthetics had positive effects on user satisfaction, whereas the effect of effort expectancy on user satisfaction was rejected. And user satisfaction was found to have a significant effect on intention to use. Conclusions: The results provide implications that strategic retail management of the above factors can motivate passengers to continuously use high-speed railways. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Extended UTAUT; Mobile Application; Retail Strategy; Use Intention; User Satisfaction",""

The discipline’s findings indicate that advertising in social media in ecotourism needs to be utilized to provide a quick understanding. Also, the advertising is updated continuously to ensure reliable and appropriate sources to meet ecotourists’ information requirements and the support of tourist product ratings. These traits should satisfy travellers, making them likely to revisit different ecotourism sights.

This study aimed to explore the digital technology acceptance process and identify barriers to use among older adults, using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 3 as a framework. This study used data from the 2018 Digital Divide Survey of the Ministry of Science and ICT in South Korea. The sample consisted of 1,662 older adults (aged 55+). The major findings of the study indicate that two environmental dimensions–personal perception (technology self-efficacy and perceived value) and social environment (social norms and social support)–significantly impact the intention to use digital technology among older adults. Furthermore, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use mediate the relationship between personal and social dimensions and intention. The implications of this study on digital inclusion in older adults can be summarized as follows: it is essential to prioritize the delivery of appropriate digital training and built supportive environments from gerontological perspectives, not just to improve digital accessibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","aged; article; digital divide; digital technology; human; self concept; social norm; social support; South Korea"

This sudden shift promotes the continuity of the teaching-learning process in HEIs despite the COVID-19 pandemic, at most on the positive side, while bringing forth challenges related to individual learners and academics. This work is based on a recently reported Values-Enhanced Technology Adoption (VETA) model, which incorporates individual values in technology acceptance modeling. Despite offering crucial insights into academics in evaluating e-learning adoption, the current literature suffers from drawbacks. Motivated by addressing these limitations, this work reevaluates the nine constructs of the VETA model using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Results indicate that effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, security, tradition, conformity, achievement, power, and hedonism constructs cause performance expectancy, behavioral intention, and social influence.

For this reason, Bitcoin Green (BITG) has been created and would solve these issues. The purpose of this paper is to visualize the users’ perception toward BITG through Twitter text analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The big data used in this study includes two sources. The first data were extracted from the “Google Trends” engine during the period between 20 September 2015 and 15 September 2020. The second data were extracted from the Twitter application. This research explores the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, the social influence, the perceived control and the user attitudes toward BITG. Therefore, lexicon-based sentiment analysis techniques combined with different dictionaries are built to visualize the drivers of investor attitudes toward the BITG using Twitter text messages. Besides, this study has checked the validity of two main assumptions using the normality (Jarque-Bera) and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests capable to conclude whether users mostly perceive BITG as a sustainable technology. Findings: This empirical work affords insights into users’ intentions by exploring the drivers of BITG perception. The results show that users positively perceive the use of BITG as a sustainable blockchain. Besides, its usefulness is more appreciated from its ethical and technological characteristics, and its perceived application is mainly based on investment and coin offering use. Similarly, users are mostly showing positive emotions toward BITG. Research limitations/implications: Tweets related to “BITG” are not as voluminous as the other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which make it difficult to extract all the characteristics and use cases. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first one that uses the theory of planned behavior and the theory of acceptance model to explore cognitive factors in understanding investor intentions in adopting BITG. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big data analytics; Bitcoin green; Emotions sentiments; Investor perception",""

First results of the Life Cycle Assessment show that lowest environmental impacts are caused by transporting hydrogen in pipelines, which is also the most cost-effective option. The preliminary survey about hydrogen refuelling stations showed that the fear of explosions is most relevant to people. Regarding added value, it could be revealed that a slight shift from domestic to more globalised expenditures is to be expected in the future. It can be concluded that hydrogen supply by pipelines is the most sustainable option.

Social capital, which consists of social networks, trust and norms, can play an active LAT extension role. This paper aims to analyze the mechanism of the role of social capital in the process of LAT extension. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data from six counties in Jiangsu, China, were used to measure social capital and analyze its effect on LAT extension using logistic regression. Data from 27 interviews were used to analyze the LAT extension experiences and problems. Findings: LAT is mainly deployed by the government to farmers and distributed among them. In this process, the village officials who form parts of the government’s composition and the villagers play a dual role that facilitates a close link between them and the farmers and ensures LAT integration. However, social norms did not play a significant role in the process. Practical implications: Farmers’ acceptance of LAT is based solely on the trade-off between local networks’ benefits and trust in local villagers and village officials. LAT-related laws and technical measures, thus are essential to strengthen LAT practices’ authority and incorporate LAT-based agricultural production as the norm of production behavior. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the process and essence of farmers’ acceptance of LAT, which provides theoretical lessons for the LAT extension in China and indeed other developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural technology extension; Environmental communication; Jiangsu China; Low-carbon agricultural technology; Social capital","agricultural production; agricultural technology; developing world; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; social capital; trade-off; willingness to pay; China; Jiangsu"

Hence, this study’s primary aim is to identify the factors that influence the middle-aged and elderly’s intention to use m-health services. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied the extended version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to explore middle-aged and elderly’s intention to use m-health services. There were 235 respondents, of which 123 (52.34%) were in the middle-aged group, whereas 112 (47.66%) were in the older group. Both groups were found to have more male participants than female participants. The partial least square (PLS) method was used to analyze data. Findings: The study found that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, technological anxiety and resistance to change (p < 0.05) had a significant influence on middle-aged intention to use m-health services. Social influence and perceived physical condition (p > 0.05) had no significant effect on middle-aged intention to use m-health services. On the other hand, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition and resistance to change (p <* 0.05) significantly influenced the elderly’s intention to use m-health services. However, the social impact of perceived physical condition and technological anxiety (p > 0.05) had no significant effect on the elderly’s intention to use m-health services. Originality/value: A good number of studies are available in the current literature, examining the factors adoption of m-health services in both developed and developing economy context. However, very few studies examine the factors that influence behavioral intention to use m-health services concerning the two different age groups, such as middle-aged and elderly.

Emergency operations in mountainous terrain are time-critical and often pose major logistical challenges for rescuers. Drones are expected to improve the operational performance of mountain rescuers. However, they are not yet widely used in mountain rescue missions. This paper examines the determinants that drive the behavioral intention of mountain rescuers to adopt drones in rescue missions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a behavioral study that builds upon an extended model of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and investigates the relationship between individual attitudes, perceptions, and intentions for drone adoption. Original survey data of 146 mountain rescuers were analyzed using moderated ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis. Findings: Results indicate that the behavioral intention to use drones in mountain rescue missions is driven by the expected performance gains and facilitating conditions. Favorable supporting conditions and experience with drones further moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention. The effects for effort expectancy, social influence, and demonstrations were not significant. Practical implications: Rescue organizations and stakeholders are recommended to consider the identified determinants in the implementation of drones in emergency logistics. Drone manufacturers targeting mountain rescue organizations are advised to focus on operational performance, provide sufficient support and training, and promote the gathering of practical experience.

Survey data was gathered from individuals physically experiencing an automated shuttle in a mixed traffic environment on public roads in Trikala (Greece) as part of the CityMobil2 project. Structural equation modelling showed that intentions to use automated shuttles were most strongly driven by hedonic motivation, followed by performance expectancy and social influence. Performance expectancy mediated the relationship between effort expectancy and behavioural intention. This means that people's expectations of how difficult automated shuttles will be to use and their intentions to use them can be explained through their expectations around how these vehicles will perform. Technology savviness was a negative moderator of the relationship between social influence and performance expectancy and facilitating conditions, respectively. Tech-savvy individuals rely less on their social networks to nurture their beliefs that automated shuttles are useful and to have the necessary resources to use automated shuttles. Car use was a negative predictor of the intention to use automated shuttles. Future research should revisit the interrelationships between the UTAUT2 constructs and apply (quasi-) experimental studies to unravel the temporal interaction between constructs.Relevance to human factors/Relevance to ergonomics theoryThe study investigated the interrelationships between the UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) constructs predicting intentions to use driverless automated shuttles.

This support should go beyond social acceptance, which is a rather passive attitude, and should include social factors such as willingness to participate in energy transition and willingness to use renewable energy sources. However, moving from awareness to action is a complex process and requires understanding of social factors. Until recently scientific research was mainly focused on technical and economic factors of energy transition however the volume of scientific results published by social science energy research is growing. The focus of this paper is on how people are making choices and which factors are influencing their choices. Research based on social sciences and behavioral economics shows preferences and rationalities of people when it comes to the question of available in frames of energy transition alternatives. The results of this paper are based on large-scale surveys, decision-making experiments and interviews conducted in Germany, Austria, Finland, Morocco, Jordan and Iran. The results show high level of awareness about the need of climate change mitigation across countries, which is decreasing with the level of details about the projects or the energy transition processes. The results also show dominance of economic rationality with concerns about energy prices and socio-economic impacts from energy transition over other concerns such as environmental protection. Also, such factors as maintenance and reparation of technology and possibility to participate in decision-making processes have impact on willingness to support energy transition which goes beyond social acceptance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral change; Co-creation; Deployment of renewable energy sources; Energy transition; Social science energy research; Trade-offs in decision making",""

Therefore, it is crucial to understand positions and conflicts in society to achieve social acceptance. This paper analyses these positions using the example of implementing hydrogen and carbon capture and storage infrastructure to decarbonise the German energy system. The empirical basis of the study are explorative stakeholder interviews which were conducted with experts from politics, economics, civil society and science and analysed within a discursive and attitudinal framework using qualitative content analysis. These stakeholder positions are assumed to represent dominant social perceptions and reflect chances and risks for acceptance. The results indicate different positions while pursuing the common goal of addressing climate change. The general conflict concerns strategies towards a low-carbon society, especially the speed of phasing-out fossil energies. Regarding the combination of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage as instrument in the context of the energy transition, the stakeholder interviews indicate controversial as well as consensual perceptions. The assessments range from rejection to deeming it absolutely necessary. Controversial argumentations refer to security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. In contrast, consensus can be reached by balancing ecological and economic arguments, e.g. by linking hydrogen technologies with renewable and fossil energy sources or by limiting the use of carbon capture and storage only to certain applications (industry, bioenergy). In further decisions, this balancing of arguments combined with openness of technology, transparency of information and citizen participation need to be considered to achieve broad acceptance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudinal research concept; Discourses; Energy transition; Germany",""

The very few studies focusing on how people perceive and react to autonomous vehicles are mainly based on online surveys. Although important, these studies measure people‘s opinions on AVs, but not their actual reaction when using them. In this paper, we assess users‘ perceptions of AVs using an immersive virtual reality experiment. We modeled autonomous boats that are intended to be deployed in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We compared users‘ reactions to manned and unmanned boats in a virtual reality environment. In total, 30 participants were exposed to a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation, where we collected skin conductance data, which was compared with a participant's responses to a questionnaire regarding perceived risk, stress, and trust toward manned and unmanned boats. The study finds that autonomous boats do not substantially influence the experienced stress, trust, or perceived risk in comparison with human-controlled boats. This article also shows the gains that virtual reality can bring to studies of the social appropriation of technologies. Results show the need for objective, quantitative data regarding the societal acceptance toward autonomous systems to better understand how these technologies will be appropriated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amsterdam; autonomous boats; Autonomous vehicles (AVs); human–robot interaction; Virtual Reality","comparative study; perception; robotics; ship technology; unmanned vehicle; virtual reality; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland"

Online renting of the used clothes is an emerging business that supports circular fashion practices leading to environmental and economic sustainability. The present study investigates the antecedents of online second-hand clothing rental platforms that drive the consumer to adopt them. Based on the theoretical underpinning of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and source credibility theory, the study finds that the utility of these platforms, ease of use, attitude, and social pressure drives the behavioral intent of the consumers to use these platforms.

Disconnecting from technology on holiday could potentially contribute to travellers’ psychological sustainability. This article aims to theorise the perceptions of millennials towards digital-free travel (DFT). We interviewed 17 millennials and applied the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) qualitatively to uncover deep insights into their perceptions. Millennials in the research believe that DFT is beneficial for their well-being, but also have concerns regarding social expectations, technology dependence and environmental support. This article firstly contributes towards the psychological sustainability from the perspective of digital well-being in tourism. Second, the qualitative use of UTAUT in a technology disconnection setting is novel. Finally, the study contributes to the empirical understanding of DFT from the aspect of millennials’ perceptions. The study proposes that mental “away” should be aligned with physical “away” by reducing technology use to achieve psychological sustainability on holiday. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital-free travel; millennials; perception; psychological sustainability; Qualitative; UTAUT","connectivity; perception; psychology; qualitative analysis; sustainability; tourist behavior; travel behavior"

It can be observed that most developed countries had begun to legalise the implementation of blockchain technology including European Union as well as the member states of G20 in order to secure their leading position in supporting the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Be that as it may, scholars admitted that Malaysia had been a bit desolated primarily in terms of its legalisation on the blockchain’s adoption in the country despite various initiatives that had been taken initially. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate the behavioural intention to adopt blockchain technology specifically among bankers in Malaysia Islamic financial system. A combination of theories, mainly the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 1 (UTAUT 1) as well as Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework had been chosen to be used in the study. This research implemented the quantitative method in which more than 200 questionnaires were distributed to 12 domestic banks in Malaysia through both self-administered method and online survey. Multiple regression analysis was applied to further verify the hypothesis made. Based on this study, it had been proven that effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating condition are the only factors that affect the behavioural intention to adopt blockchain technology with effort expectancy being the most significant factor among all. However, the results had also proven that the non-factors of the variables strengthened the fact that Malaysia is still at the primitive stage in respect to blockchain adoption. Thus, it signifies the importance for the industry to begin adopting instead of attempting by considering the best initiatives recommended in accordance to Malaysia’s mould in which the banks could opt to start working on the institution voluntary regulation whereas for the government, perhaps they could commence a consortium which consists of Islamic financial institutions in the country to develop their experience before implementing on their own. It is hopeful that the initiatives could help to secure the position of Malaysia as the world Islamic financial hub in the coming years. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioural Intention; Blockchain Technology; Islamic Financial System; TOE Framework; UTAUT",""
