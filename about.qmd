## 📘 Project overview

This repository provides **open, transparent, and reproducible research materials** supporting the conceptual and analytical development of an **extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** for the study of green technology adoption.

Rather than offering primary empirical datasets or predictive models, the repository documents the **analytical workflow**, **bibliometric procedures**, and **conceptual structuring** that underpin the article’s theoretical contribution. The materials are intended to support **methodological transparency**, **interpretative clarity**, and the **use of the proposed framework** in future empirical research.

The project integrates perspectives from **environmental psychology**, **behavioural public policy**, and **sustainability governance**, with a particular focus on institutional dimensions such as trust, legitimacy, transparency, and community support.

## 📁 Repository structure

-   `docs/`\
    Rendered project website (GitHub Pages) generated with Quarto, including the research companion page, reproducible educational notebook, and documentation supporting transparency and reuse.

-   `scripts/`\
    Reproducible R scripts used for bibliometric mapping, semantic analysis, and figure generation, including workflows based on VOSviewer outputs.

-   `data/`\
    Bibliometric datasets used in the study, including raw metadata exported from Scopus and cleaned datasets derived during preprocessing.\
    Processed data files such as `keywords_list.json` contain the keyword co-occurrence network exported from VOSviewer and used as input for the bibliometric visualisations and analyses.

-   `figures_tiff/`\
    Publication-ready bibliometric figures and conceptual diagrams corresponding to the main article and Supplementary Material, exported in high-resolution TIFF format (300 dpi).

-   `images/`\
    Visual assets and schematic illustrations used for the project website and explanatory materials (non-publication figures).

-   `references/`\
    Bibliographic references and citation files used in the manuscript and supplementary analyses.

## 🔁 Reproducibility and transparency

This repository follows principles of **open science**, **conceptual reproducibility**, and **methodological transparency**.\
All analytical steps reported in the article are documented to allow other researchers to:

-   trace the analytical logic of the study,
-   reproduce the bibliometric mapping procedures,
-   adapt the conceptual framework to alternative sustainability or policy contexts.

The materials are provided for **research and educational purposes**, and are not intended to function as a ready-made predictive or decision-support tool.

All materials are versioned and archived via Zenodo to ensure long-term preservation and citability.
